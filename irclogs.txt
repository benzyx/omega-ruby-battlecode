00:00 < jeffreyxiao> if the bullets don't touch you
00:00 < jeffreyxiao> you don't take damage
00:00 < Hjax> XD
00:00 < CertifiedPyro> lol
00:00 < Hjax> jeffreyxiao: i do have to say, your code is really impressive
00:00 < Hjax> especially your dodging and gardener code

00:16 < battlecode483> i like how @CertifiedPryro is looking at all the bullets as a force vector right?
00:17 < battlecode483> because that helps with not only dodging the nearest but also begins dodging the ones after itt
00:17 < battlecode483> if i'm understanding that correctly

00:20 < CertifiedPyro> yeah
00:20 < CertifiedPyro> only problem it has is that it sort of gets stuck on map edges, so you'll have to add extra forces to counter that
00:21 -!- ashdnazg|afk is now known as ashdnazg
00:21 < CertifiedPyro> i haven't been able to figure out how to dodge and move towards a certain target at the same time
00:21 < ashdnazg> morning #battolcowd
00:22 < battlecode483> that's what i was going to suggest, also look at who's trees are around and move towards cover that you want them hitting
00:23 < CertifiedPyro> yeah. I already use enemy trees to dodge stuff and hit gardeners who trap themselves, but that's separate from dodging code
00:23 -!- battlecode483 is now known as jarjarbits
00:23 < CertifiedPyro> neutral trees are slightly harder, since their radius can be >1. i haven't implemented that yet, but i assume it's not too hard
00:24 < jarjarbits> also if you factor in health, if you have multiple units you are trying to help, you can maybe sacrifice the ones dying off to keep the stronger ones around longer... but that's super difficult
00:25 < CertifiedPyro> i actually use 0 broadcasts in my code, because that stuff's annoying. i know i have to eventually though

00:31 < ashdnazg> so when people told me stream is "tomorrow noon" yesterday, they meant MIT noon, right?
00:31 < CertifiedPyro> yup, eastern time
00:32 < ashdnazg> so 12 hours from now

00:36 < jarjarbits> @CertifiedPyro any luck with passing data by encoding it in  map location?
00:36 < jarjarbits> you can do that for close units
00:37 < jarjarbits> and scouts could quickly propagate that knowledge
00:37 < CertifiedPyro> i haven't thought of it, might try it out
00:37 < jarjarbits> (feel free to not give away any secrets here, sorry if i'm asking too much)
00:37 < jarjarbits> you lose the possibility to move as freely
00:37 < jarjarbits> but you can read in those last digits as data
00:38 < jarjarbits> so your other nearby bots that see that position know the state/thoughts of that bot and can work with it not against it

00:47 < jarjarbits> gl in sprint
00:47 < PM_ME_YOUR_DODGE> we uploaded wrong jar for sprint

00:50 < PM_ME_YOUR_DODGE> @jarjarbits ty for helping though
00:50 < PM_ME_YOUR_DODGE> guess we can try though, our old jar is basically the same
00:50 < jarjarbits> @yeah, but rolling back might be seen as more of a disadvantage to you can i think the others would say it's fair, true, it is what it is, but i don't think it would be dishonest to ask for that and let them decide
00:51 < jarjarbits> hahah @ wrong name there
00:51 < PM_ME_YOUR_DODGE> haha oops
00:51 < PM_ME_YOUR_DODGE> yeah we'll try asking

00:52 < jarjarbits> 99.9f % chance they will say no :-/
00:53 < ashdnazg> indeed
00:53 < tfk> would've been better if you'd asked earlier
00:53 < ashdnazg> that's what deadlines are for
00:53 < tfk> 99% chance they'd have said yes if it was just an hour or so after deadline
00:53 < ashdnazg> ya
00:53 < tfk> they might've already started tournament
00:54 < ashdnazg> they even extended the deadline IIRC
00:54 < ashdnazg> I was a bit sleepy then though
00:54 < jarjarbits> yeah, i think they did
00:54 < tfk> I think it closed at 5:30
00:54 < tfk> right
00:54 < tfk> that's what it was originally
00:54 < tfk> or 5 or something
00:55 < ashdnazg> timezones are insane, there are people here from Europe, US, Australia etc. so whenever you're asleep, someone is changing the meta/improving their micro
00:55 -!- Daku1 [~Alex@wsip-70-163-68-27.ga.at.cox.net] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
00:56 < tfk> ideally you want to have teammates in those timezones
00:56 < tfk> lol
00:56 < ashdnazg> ye I fucked up, my teammate is one timezone away from me
00:56 < tfk> convince them to relocate
00:57 < ashdnazg> will try and get back to you :P
00:57 < globalpointer> just use it to have 24h watch on the meta
00:57 < jarjarbits> i have a secret 24 person team evenly spanning time zones... we post under one name, me and have as a group come up with the example bot
00:57 < globalpointer> flawless
00:57 < ashdnazg> jarjarbits: :D
00:57 < tfk> diminishing returns
00:57 < jarjarbits> ehhehe
00:57 < tfk> probably 2 or 3 teams would be optimal
00:58 < tfk> probably 2 teams of 2 people
00:58 < tfk> on opposite time zones
00:58 < tfk> is optimal
00:58 < ashdnazg> probably
00:58 < tfk> or one person who doesn't need to sleep
00:58 < ashdnazg> like a relay race
00:58 < tfk> yea relay race
00:59 < tfk> it has disadvantages
00:59 < ashdnazg> you use the shared wake hours to pass info and updates
00:59 < tfk> you don't have to worry about synchronization
00:59 < tfk> but at the same time
00:59 < tfk> you don't get to error correct each other in a timely fashion
00:59 < jarjarbits> i also have a mole in the dev team
00:59 < ashdnazg> timely fashion can be very flexible
00:59 < jarjarbits> you know, pulling out all the stops here
01:00 < tfk> I have a mole in amazon web services
01:00 < tfk> lol jk
01:00 < tfk> <_<
01:00 < ashdnazg> even with a contemporary teammate you sometimes work on stuff too much time before pushing to the repo
01:00 < tfk> if your bots spontaneously get bit errors
01:00 < tfk> not my doing
01:01 < ashdnazg> so review isn't always timely
01:01 < tfk> yea
01:01 < tfk> there's a lot of code that needs to be written for testing
01:01 < tfk> that never ends up being in bot
01:01 < tfk> so synchronization isn't really too bad

01:03 < jarjarbits> maybe i could have written a bot if i blogged less and coded more, lol
01:04 < jarjarbits> but i can't win prizes anyway, so i like the off chance of helping someone else with their ideas
01:04 < tfk> you're not a student?
01:04 < jarjarbits> and whoever has been clicking ads is awesome, lol, thanks
01:04 < jarjarbits> nope
01:04 < tfk> probably russian bots
01:04 < tfk> lol
01:04 < tfk> although maybe real people
01:04 < jarjarbits> already graduated, but have still been taking tons of free online classes
01:05 < tfk> ah
01:05 < tfk> I graduated in 2012
01:05 < jarjarbits> i love the computer vision and machine learning and self driving courses
01:05 < tfk> and then decided to not leave
01:05 < jarjarbits> nice
01:05 < jarjarbits> doing a masters now?
01:05 < tfk> no I got my masters in 2013
01:05 < tfk> phd
01:06 < jarjarbits> sweet
01:06 < ashdnazg> tfk: neat, what do you research?
01:06 < jarjarbits> you sound like my last roommate, he was becoming a career student
01:06 < tfk> performance engineering and parallel algorithms
01:06 < ashdnazg> nice!
01:06 < tfk> I just make things go fast by not being dumb
01:07 < ashdnazg> cache aware or unaware?
01:07 < tfk> and then write about it
01:07 < tfk> I care about perf, so of course aware of caching
01:07 < tfk> lol
01:07 < ashdnazg> no no
01:07 < tfk> oh you mean cache oblivious?
01:07 < ashdnazg> ah yes
01:07 < ashdnazg> sorry

01:08 < tfk> currently I've been working on "big data" problems
01:08 < tfk> that are dumb because they're not really "big data"
01:08 < tfk> and showing how you can solve them on a small multicore
01:08 < tfk> like 100x faster than on a distributed cluster
01:08 < ashdnazg> I've studied it a bit, communication cost and all this stuff is quite complex
01:09 < tfk> there are simple rules that can basically let you beat distributed clusters
01:09 < ashdnazg> such as?
01:09 < tfk> basically: work on chunks that fit into L3 cache
01:09 < ashdnazg> well, obviously
01:09 < tfk> parallelize on a single socket everything fitting into L3
01:10 < tfk> and make sure you're code vectorizes
01:10 < tfk> yea obviously...
01:10 < tfk> but people don't do it
01:10 < tfk> lol
01:10 < ashdnazg> right
01:10 < tfk> and you can literally get 100x speedup
01:10 < ashdnazg> people don't do much low level nowadays
01:10 < tfk> over like 20 papers that try and do it on gpus and distributed clusters
01:11 < tfk> which translates into like paying $1 for a computation that other people solve with 100k
01:11 < tfk> (due to paying for hardware for custom clusters)
01:11 < ashdnazg> and especially data scientists are very pro in ML and python and matlab and whatnot, but haven't C'd enough to learn about cache locality
01:11 < tfk> yea python is really a scourge
01:12 < jarjarbits> do you have any links to your stuff @tfk that i could read up on
01:12 < ashdnazg> python is wonderful
01:12 < tfk> we have a good paper in ppopp 2017
01:12 < tfk> unsure if pdf is up yet
01:12 < ashdnazg> it saves dev time
01:12 < tfk> multicore path to connectomics on-demand
01:12 < ashdnazg> it doesn't save running time

01:13 < tfk> but that's not it
01:13 < ashdnazg> I'm doing my master's on heuristic search and we're also working very hard to fit stuff in memory
01:14 < ashdnazg> with really big graphs it can require some creativity ^^
01:14 < tfk> you should read graphchi

01:14 < tfk> I don't know how good it would be for branch-and-bound
01:14 < tfk> type workloads
01:15 < tfk> but it is a good example of how to do big graph computations on small machines
01:15 < tfk> and also a good example of how everyone in distributed computing is too young to have learned anything about external memory algorithms ;)
01:15 < ashdnazg> well, my C++ code is rather efficient, I go over a billion states in less than a minute, so should be ok
01:16 < ashdnazg> our approach is mostly algorithmical
01:16 < ashdnazg> about time-space trade-offs
01:16 < tfk> branch and bound really is application specific I think
01:17 < tfk> you don't really care about nps as much as you care about nps / parallel-node-blowup
01:17 < tfk> (assuming you parallelized)
01:17 < jarjarbits> @ashdnazg any links to your stuff i could read/learn up about
01:17 < ashdnazg> not yet, but algorithm is trivially parallelisable
01:17 < tfk> is it really branch and bound?

01:18 < ashdnazg> jarjarbits: well, learn A* and IDA*
01:18 < ashdnazg> tfk mostly this stuff ^
01:18 < ashdnazg> and variants
01:19 < ashdnazg> less B&B
01:19 < ashdnazg> and IDA* is trivially parallelisable
01:19 < jarjarbits> i love learning, and talking to people smarter than i so i can learn more
01:19 < tfk> I mean
01:19 < ashdnazg> I can't promise I'm smarter XD
01:19 < tfk> there are methods for parallelizing A*
01:19 < tfk> but I wouldn't call it trivially parallelizable
01:19 < ashdnazg> A* is less prallelisable
01:19 < jarjarbits> everyone is smarter at some things and not at others
01:20 < ashdnazg> but it's not memory bounded
01:20 < ashdnazg> and quite wasteful
01:20 < ashdnazg> jarjarbits: fair enough
01:20 < jarjarbits> so assuming you guys wrote a lot of code to archons, did yall chuck that so that the other troops can process it?
01:21 < ashdnazg> actually I didn't write all that much code for Archons
01:21 < tfk> my archon still runs to the enemy base
01:21 < jarjarbits> hehe
01:21 < jarjarbits> do what they never expect to plan for
01:21 < ashdnazg> I have some chores for the first unit to do, mostly processing reports and updating lists in the broadcast area
01:21 < jarjarbits> lol, best strat
01:22 < ashdnazg> but it's not more than a few thousands bytecodes
01:22 < tfk> people will probably waste bullets on it
01:22 < tfk> lol
01:22 < ashdnazg> actually yes
01:22 < ashdnazg> tanking with archon is a good strat against soldiers
01:22 < ashdnazg> but scouts are nasty little buggers
01:22 < tfk> I only win if my first 2 soldiers win
01:22 < jarjarbits> if your archons die off your supply line begins to die off
01:22 < tfk> or if the map is like big enough that I get enough units to prevent scouts from killing gardeners
01:23 < tfk> yea but it works out: map small archons get to enemy and die fast
01:23 < tfk> I only win if rush wins
01:23 < jarjarbits> i wonder what is going to show up tomorrow that points out assumptions people made about the game
01:23 < tfk> map big or separated by trees: my archons never make it to enemy (at least for awhile)
01:25 < ashdnazg> I predict lots of trees
01:25 < ashdnazg> pathing galore
01:25 < ashdnazg> and scouts OP
01:25 < ashdnazg> because best pathing is no pathing
01:30 < tfk> I'm curious to see the_duck's bot
01:30 < tfk> haven't seen him play yet
01:31 < jarjarbits> wait didn't duck win the last two
01:31 < tfk> last 3 maybe?
01:31 < tfk> lol
01:31 < jarjarbits> so someone should have gone with the name goose, lol
01:32 < tfk> last year, year before and year before
01:32 < tfk> yea so last 3
01:32 < jarjarbits> duck, duck, duck... goose
01:32 < jarjarbits> :-)
01:32 < tfk> damn
01:32 < tfk> I should've made my team named goose
01:32 < jarjarbits> i'm a child, lol
01:32 < tfk> oh well too late
01:33 < ashdnazg> we live with our mistakes forever
01:33 < ashdnazg> I should've called my team 17th place
01:33 < tfk> short memory leads to fewer regrets
01:33 < tfk> my great grandmother told me that
01:33 < tfk> wise woman
01:33 < ashdnazg> I remember everything except things I have to do
01:33 < ashdnazg> so regrets are in
01:34 < ashdnazg> no control over that :(
01:35 < tfk> my best team names I think were "lowercase_letters" and "Designed by Committee"
01:36 < ashdnazg> :D
01:36 < tfk> former was just funny (at least to me, and I wrote my strategy report in all lowercase letters)
01:36 < tfk> latter was appropriate
01:36 < tfk> because the game was like total fan service
01:36 < tfk> units that fire rockets
01:36 < ashdnazg> you could annoy many people with "Camel_case"
01:36 < tfk> that you control for 5 turns manually
01:36 < tfk> and all sorts of other stuff
01:36 < tfk> lol
01:36 < uvafan> launchers op
01:36 < uvafan> they kept nerfing them and they were still op
01:36 < tfk> yea that is my 2nd favorite battlecode year
01:36 < uvafan> and no one used bashers even though they kept buffing them lmao
01:36 < tfk> 1st was 2013 by fun gamers
01:37 < ashdnazg> uvafan: envisioning same fate for scouts?
01:37 < uvafan> depends how much they nerf scouts by
01:37 < tfk> they were too cautious with buffs/nerfs that year
01:37 < ashdnazg> tanks will never be popular because pathing
01:37 < jarjarbits> LOWERCASE_LETTERS
01:37 < tfk> the game was still great though
01:37 < jarjarbits> hehe
01:37 < tfk> pathing is fine I think
01:37 < uvafan> the ore mining mechanic was really cool that year
01:37 < tfk> tanks are annoying mainly because you have to special case pathing code for them
01:37 < tfk> since you can't use canMove
01:38 < tfk> but its not hard, just annoying
01:38 < tfk> yea 2015 was fantastic
01:38 < ashdnazg> tfk: with many trees tanks can't necessarily reach target in relevant time
01:38 < tfk> total fan service
01:38 < tfk> lol
01:38 < tfk> @ashdnazg I doubt it'll ever be a rush
01:39 < tfk> but depending on what happens to scouts
01:39 < tfk> soldiers+tanks might be a good strat
01:39 < ashdnazg> we will see
01:39 < tfk> or lumberjack tank
01:39 < tfk> yea idk
01:39 < tfk> we'll see
01:39 < tfk> tank's hp buff was pretty big
01:39 < jarjarbits> yeah, i was thinking lumberjack  helping make paths for tanks
01:39 < jarjarbits> build highways
01:39 < jarjarbits> and then keep them clear when needed again
01:40 < tfk> I think bug + condition for plowing through
01:40 < tfk> might be fine
01:40 < jarjarbits> yeah
01:41 < uvafan> lumberjacks are so situational i feel
01:41 < uvafan> they just get massacred if they're in the middle of a soldier on soldier war
01:42 < tfk> yea
01:42 < uvafan> they're probbaly only good for clearing trees and maybe hitting scouts in trees until they fix scouts
01:42 < tfk> right now swarms of lumberjacks do pretty good
01:42 < tfk> just because they're simply to code
01:42 < tfk> and folks focused on macro instead
01:42 < uvafan> yeah but that's not a good long term strat
01:42 < tfk> probably not
01:42 < uvafan> eventually people will have good soldier micro
01:42 < tfk> they get eaten by soldiers
01:42 < uvafan> yedah
01:42 < uvafan> kiting and penta shots combined
01:42 < tfk> or just kiting
01:43 < tfk> I think I single shot lumberjacks
01:43 < tfk> mainly to avoid wasting bullets
01:43 < tfk> if they like start orbiting me
01:44 < uvafan> yeah it's tough to decide shot type
01:44 < uvafan> that's something we need to do better
01:45 < tfk> I need to fix my defend code
01:45 < tfk> so that I can have a bot that I can test different shot code against
01:45 < tfk> lol

01:47 < jarjarbits> i think saving bullets is their big thing
01:47 < jarjarbits> bullets are everything here
01:48 < tfk> probably good for defense
01:48 < tfk> or just a bullet shield
01:48 < tfk> lol
01:48 < tfk> if you are watering 5 gardens
01:48 < jarjarbits> canon fodder
01:48 < tfk> its worthwhile to sacrifice a lumberjack
01:48 < jarjarbits> ^ true
01:49 < tfk> near strategy
01:49 < tfk> new strat
01:49 < tfk> that uses tanks
01:49 < tfk> you just build tanks
01:49 < tfk> to form walls around your gardeners
01:49 < tfk> lol
01:49 < tfk> no shooting
01:49 < tfk> they just sit there
01:49 < CertifiedPyro> that's so expensive though
01:49 < tfk> cheaper per hp
01:49 < tfk> I think
01:49 < tfk> plus they are big
01:49 < jarjarbits> land a scout on your tank, so you shot yourself
01:50 < jarjarbits> on their tank actually i meant
01:50 < jarjarbits> you can do that right?
01:50 < tfk> I don't think so
01:50 < tfk> scouts can't intersect other units
01:50 < jarjarbits> ah, thought so
01:50 < jarjarbits> dang
01:51 < tfk> corner turtle
01:51 < tfk> build tanks
01:51 < tfk> and then when you get a new tank
01:51 < tfk> expand out from corner
01:51 < tfk> lol
01:51 < jarjarbits> hehe
01:51 < tfk> costs more bullets to kill tank
01:51 < tfk> than it costs to build tank
01:51 < tfk> (with scouts)
01:52 < tfk> pthen when you reach map midpoint
01:52 < tfk> just have the tanks start firing
01:52 < tfk> lol

01:57 < ashdnazg> jarjarbits: yes
01:57 < ashdnazg> I think 3 scouts can kill a soldier currently without getting hit
01:58 < ashdnazg> and the soldier can't get away
01:58 < jarjarbits> and a good defense to that is to signal distress when trapped so others can attack the distracted bots ganging up on the other one

02:39 < gongy> wanted to ask about us unis
02:40 < jarjarbits> @gongy are you groggy
02:40 < ashdnazg> ah, can't help you there :D
02:40 < gongy> and if they have mandated courses for english/writing which are annoying and effort
02:40 < jarjarbits> hehe
02:40 < gongy> nice
02:40 < gongy> groggy is more similar to gongy

02:40 < ashdnazg> so why would you need English courses?

02:42 < ashdnazg> anyway, I hadn't a single language course in uni which wasn't a programming language :D

11:29 < jhalliday> a block of ~4k ids is allocated, then shuffled randomly. so you can't count on much w.r.t. ordering, though most games don't exceed one block which helps a bit when making assumptions for compression+communication of id values.

13:14 < tfk> yea

17:09 < battlecode201> both seem to be really strong
17:09 < gp[why]> did we even play on chess? I don't think we did
17:09 < gongy> thank you, to you too
17:09 < gongy> we won on chess by victory
17:09 < battlecode201> i guess its the one with the little tree squares
17:09 < gongy> pts
17:09 < kuroba> not too salty, since we did lose g2 legitimately
17:09 < gp[why]> I mean it all doesn't matter now, we won because of scouts + turn order detection probs
17:10 < gongy> kuroba, by legitimately
17:10 < gongy> you mean turn order right
17:10 < gongy> fuck my life
17:10 < kuroba> ?
17:10 < battlecode201> yeah i heavily abuse that too, so will probably get way worse once they fix that
17:10 < gp[why]> yep
17:10 < gongy> us too
17:10 < kuroba> we abuse it too
17:10 < gongy> we backed up for it
17:10 < kuroba> its going to get patched
17:10 < gongy> so we can fall back to like 3 days ago lol
17:10 < battlecode201> is the match u panywhere to rewatch? went so fast
17:10 < kuroba> we keep a hash table of all seen enemy ids so far in the channels, then we copy it to every new unit that spawns to know which units it can kill 100%
17:10 < gongy> not up yet
17:11 < gongy> WOW HASH TABLE
17:11 < gongy> like... a legit hash table?

17:11 < gp[why]> lol we didn't do any channel communication for it
17:11 < kuroba> it's like, impossible to know for sure
17:11 < gp[why]> we just array it
17:11 < kuroba> unless you track it
17:11 < gp[why]> for each scout
17:12 < gongy> each scout has an array
17:12 < battlecode201> yeah i do the same, mostly just let every unit figure out what to do, with a couple of macro broadcasts thrown in
17:12 < gongy> it figures it out on its own
17:12 < kuroba> of things it see
17:13 < gongy> duuuuude

17:28 < u___> i have no idea what rocket is like, never played em
17:29 < u___> so whats the gist with the meta
17:29 < u___> scouts dominate?
17:29 < u___> Deep Noot xD
17:30 < CertifiedPyro> turns out digging your archons out of tight spaces is quite important, especially on the new maps
17:30 < u___> ahhh
17:30 < u___> yeah that explains it
17:30 -!- farisisape [d1760c92@gateway/web/cgi-irc/kiwiirc.com/ip.209.118.12.146] has joined #battlecode
17:30 < u___> i focused a ton of lumberjack clearing
17:30 < u___> cause my bots had trouble with it on magicwood and lineoffire
17:31 < CertifiedPyro> yeah, there's like 2 maps where one archon is completely surrounded by trees and can't build anything
17:31 < gongy> rip the one with two archones surrounded...
17:31 < gongy> that's so frustrating for waterloo
17:31 < u___> oh crap
17:32 < u___> i bet no one checks for that CertifiedPyro xD
17:32 < CertifiedPyro> yeah, it's how waterloo lost
17:32 < CertifiedPyro> because their leader archon was one of the ones trapped
17:32 -!- ballz117 [~alex@dhcp-18-111-11-122.dyn.mit.edu] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
17:32 < CertifiedPyro> so it couldn't build anything
17:32 < u___> mine arbitrarily picks an archon to use
17:32 < u___> just the first one to execute
17:32 < u___> so basically luck
17:32 < u___> oh yeah
17:32 -!- ballz117 [~alex@dhcp-18-111-11-122.dyn.mit.edu] has joined #battlecode
17:33 < u___> prolly the case for most people
17:33 < VeniVidiVici> ours doesn't bother electing a leader
17:33 < VeniVidiVici> just has everything build if possible lol
17:33 < gongy> we use the first one which builds a gardener
17:33 < gongy> which is lucky
17:33 < CertifiedPyro> VeniVidiVici: that was a good match between us btw :p
17:33 < VeniVidiVici> yeah goddamn that first game was intense
17:33 < u___> thing is you really dont wanna use 2 archons in the beginning
17:33 < u___> cause then you have more than 1 gardener to defend from scouts
17:33 < CertifiedPyro> yeah, i have terrible micro, so i lose on cramped maps really easily
17:33 < VeniVidiVici> yeah we don't make >1 gardener
17:34 < VeniVidiVici> our micro's pretty bad but better than most i think
17:34 < VeniVidiVici> loses to all top teams cleanly but beats the midranked teams

17:55 < tfk> scouts can no longer attack
17:55 < tfk> I think
17:55 < kuroba> theres a git merge request with that change
17:55 < kuroba> i hope it doesnt go through
17:55 < kuroba> thats a bit too much
17:55 < tfk> I think it would be a fine fix
17:55 < u___> ehh
17:55 < tfk> basically something has to give
17:55 < u___> thats too far imo
17:56 < u___> you can defend against scouts
17:56 < u___> they should be weaker but not that weak
17:56 < VeniVidiVici> what?
17:57 < tfk> oh they fixed shrine
17:57 < VeniVidiVici> if scouts can't attack you just turtle every map and autowin
17:57 < tfk> to get rid of archon id 0
17:57 < tfk> lol
17:57 < tfk> and nice new messaging methods with floats and booleans

17:58 < u___> zzz messaging methods for bools and floats?

18:10 < u___> tfk i think in general the earlygame is way too delicate
18:10 < u___> they should increase costs and give a higher passive income at the start
18:10 < tfk> perhaps
18:10 < u___> as it is now whoever gets their exponential growth going earlier wins
18:10 < u___> a tiny setback means death
18:10 < tfk> it might be that gardens need to be nerfed a little
18:10 < CertifiedPyro> yeah, it means teams have to super micro manage their early game
18:10 < tfk> idk
18:11 < u___> well yeah what i suggested is equivalent to that
18:11 < tfk> oh yea with increased costs
18:11 < u___> reduce bullet tree income relative to everything else
18:11 < u___> cause bullet trees are like super snowbally
18:11 < tfk> it might also be good to have some negative feedback with units
18:12 < tfk> yea thats true
18:12 < u___> yeah well they had negative feedback in 2014 right
18:12 < u___> there was a cap of like 22 units
18:12 < u___> thats a bit extreme though lol it was like a straightjacket
18:12 < tfk> yea
18:13 < tfk> idk I think scouts are the biggest issue now
18:13 < gp[why]> I just don't like gimmick maps with bo3s ~_~
18:13 < CertifiedPyro> yeah, i think especially early game scout rush is snowbally
18:13 < tfk> bo3s?
18:13 < VeniVidiVici> best of 3
18:13 < gp[why]> best of 3s
18:13 < tfk> so I can beat my bot
18:13 < tfk> on a few maps
18:13 < tfk> with a bot that just makes scouts
18:13 < tfk> and only attacks gardeners
18:14 < VeniVidiVici> i think the main issue is that killing a gardener is basically game over
18:14 < VeniVidiVici> or well a huge tempo less at least
18:14 < VeniVidiVici> so you have to invest too much into trying to defend it
18:14 < u___> lol kazimuth is like "waterloo omega ruby has planted *a tree*, which puts them in a pretty good position"
18:15 < VeniVidiVici> lol
18:15 < u___> sums up the snowball thing
18:15 < tfk> haha commentary is hard
18:15 < u___> no but it's true
18:15 < u___> 1 tree vs 0 tree
18:15 < VeniVidiVici> it's p true though
18:15 < VeniVidiVici> like the early game is send a scout to enemy
18:15 < VeniVidiVici> if you kill their gardener you win
18:15 < VeniVidiVici> if they kill your gardener you lose
18:15 < VeniVidiVici> if your scout dies you lose
18:15 < tfk> it would be nice for there to be an incentive to kill enemy trees maybe
18:15 < VeniVidiVici> if both scouts die then you have an actual game
18:15 < tfk> I think fixing the scout issue will help a lot
18:15 < VeniVidiVici> makes the game 90% micro
18:16 < tfk> it's a lot easier to defend against non-scouts
18:16 < VeniVidiVici> but scouts are also necessary
18:16 < CertifiedPyro> incentive wouldn't really work, trees are too hard to kill without soldiers or lumberjacks
18:16 < VeniVidiVici> because if you just flower gardeners then they're unkillable otherwise
18:16 < tfk> right now the time it tanks for a tree to die when a gardener isn't watering it
18:16 < tfk> is pretty short
18:16 < tfk> my gardeners when they flee
18:16 < tfk> get back to the tree only like just barely in time
18:17 < VeniVidiVici> most people aren't moving gardener i think

18:26 < Snafets> what growth
18:26 < u___> line set it up so that the graph is straight for like the first 500 turns
18:26 < u___> Snafets: just growth in general, like, bullet trees are basically exponential growth, if you build 2 trees at the start you've already doubled your income
18:27 < Snafets> after 80 turns i belive but yes
18:27 < Snafets> so have higher basic income
18:27 < Snafets> that would favor rushes though

19:00 < VeniVidiVici> do ratings have any meaning anymore
19:00 < CertifiedPyro> i believe they still matter for seeding tournament
19:00 < RattatasPokeball> They have seedings for the seeding tournament I think
19:00 < VeniVidiVici> are they being reset or no

19:12 < RattatasPokeball> I believe not
19:12 < Stary> no
19:13 < RattatasPokeball> since if it did my code should have thrown an exception any time it wanted to shoot
19:13 < Stary> if it did my robots would shoot themselves
19:13 < RattatasPokeball> Nah I check for that, but my collision code explicitly refuses to work when the two entities are at the same point

19:34 < kodomodo> yes
19:35 < kodomodo> thas me
19:36 < kodomodo> Is there a reason for red team winning most matches?
19:37 < darthjarjar> the red teams were the higher seeds
19:37 < darthjarjar> so better bots
19:37 < CertifiedPyro> you mean in sprint tournament? red team was higher seed
19:37 < gendelpiekel> darthjarjar, dude I watched your games, bl with that planting rng... :(
19:37 < darthjarjar> gendelpiekel it's all good, we had no chance of winning the whole thing either way
19:37 < darthjarjar> might as well not get any hope
19:37 < VeniVidiVici> red definitely wasn't always higher seed
19:38 < darthjarjar> the funny thing is the reason that happened was there was an argument we passed in to our gardener for a spot to leave open
19:38 < VeniVidiVici> we played red vs rocket for example
19:38 < darthjarjar> and i thought it was the spot we tried to build it in lmao
19:38 < darthjarjar> oops
19:38 < gendelpiekel> VeniVidiVici, like... if the higher seed always won, then the higher seed would always be red
19:38 < gendelpiekel> but if you beat someone with a higher seed, the brackets don't change
19:38 < VeniVidiVici> but rocket was 2 seed
19:39 < darthjarjar> VeniVidiVici you were blue?
19:39 < gendelpiekel> huh...
19:39 < darthjarjar> https://www.battlecode.org/tournaments/watch/SPRINT/1267
19:39 < darthjarjar> he was blue vs rocket
19:39 < darthjarjar> because rocket was higher seed and hadn't gotten upset
19:40 < darthjarjar> if someone had upset rocket that team would have been red and you woudl have remained blue
19:40 < VeniVidiVici> oh lol
19:40 < VeniVidiVici> we were in bottom right so i thought red

20:24 < jarjarbits> within a couple days

20:25 < meatkat> They aren't finalized yet.
20:25 < kodomodo> it was leaked on WikiLeaks

20:35 < battlecode938> Hey guys! I have a question. After watching some of today's sprint tournament, I'm wondering how the lines (when the units dash from unit to unit) are created.
20:35 < CertifiedPyro> rc.setIndicatorLine
20:35 < Valid_> Theyre indicator lines
20:36 < battlecode938> ohh okay thank you!
20:36 -!- meatkat [~Mutter@c-71-63-231-164.hsd1.or.comcast.net] has quit [Client Quit]
20:36 < Valid_> takes a start and end point as well as RGB values
20:36 < jarjarbits> they are cool, but i kind of wish they didn't mask bullets
20:37 < Valid_> Pyro, has it been storming over there?
20:37 < Valid_> I agree Jar
20:37 < CertifiedPyro> not really, it's been raining on and off
20:37 < RattatasPokeball> maybe make indicator lines have 60% opacity
20:37 < RattatasPokeball> so stuff still shows through
20:37 < Valid_> I agree RattatasPokeball
20:37 < jarjarbits> or bullets layer on top
20:38 < jarjarbits> but yeah, opacity would be cooler
20:38 -!- Kelvin [47e98a2f@gateway/web/cgi-irc/kiwiirc.com/ip.71.233.138.47] has joined #battlecode
20:38 < RattatasPokeball> Nah, well let's just say I might be covering a very large part of the map next time
20:38 < Valid_> I think the problem with the bullet layer higher is that some colors will still make it dif. to see the bullets
20:38 < Valid_> But id rather have that than nothing haha
20:38 < RattatasPokeball> The Pok?ball was coded in 15 minutes, literally
20:39 < jarjarbits> i thought of that, but you get to pick the color, so you can fix it then if you want
20:39 < Valid_> Very true
20:39 < jarjarbits> on top with an auto-inverted color would be the best probably
20:40 < kodomodo> ^^
20:40 < kodomodo> What is the best method for building trees on maps like LineOfFire?
20:40 < RattatasPokeball> what do you mean auto-inverted
20:41 < jarjarbits> automatically the opposite color of the color you pick for the line under it
20:41 < kodomodo> bullets are inverse color of whatever indicator line is below them
20:41 < jarjarbits> so if a black line, a while bullet would go above it
20:41 < RattatasPokeball> Eh, but what about robots?
20:41 < jarjarbits> i think just the lines made it hard tosee
20:41 < jarjarbits> to see
20:41 < kodomodo> yeah opacity might be a good fix
20:42 < RattatasPokeball> Even 50% but 50% might be a bit low
20:42 < kodomodo> one more thing I want to see is showing only one robot's indicator lines/dots
20:42 < kodomodo> like if you click on it

21:13 < penlu> the reason it's no decay is that nominally if you leave it alone its health is still increasing
21:13 < penlu> however, most people have their gardener set up to water it full anyway
21:13 < penlu> so then you get this awkward hang at full health before it starts coming down

21:35 < battlecode426> any idea how scouts will be nerfed (if they will)?
21:36 -!- ballz117 [~alex@dhcp-18-111-11-122.dyn.MIT.EDU] has joined #battlecode
21:36 < CertifiedPyro> no idea. i think somebody proposed not letting scouts attack, but i don't think that change's going through
21:36 < Valid_> That would break so many people lmao
21:37 < battlecode426> I think that would be a good idea, tbh
21:37 < battlecode426> Scouts couldn't attack last year
21:37 < CertifiedPyro> it would make things...interesting, to say the least
21:37 < battlecode426> Given that our scout code sucks, I would be okay with that
21:37 < Valid_> Its too far into the competition to make some a game changing move imo
21:38 < Valid_> such a game changing*
21:38 < battlecode426> you think so?
21:38 < CertifiedPyro> so many people rely on it
21:38 < CertifiedPyro> it's a very dominant strategy
21:39 < battlecode426> It is rediculous that a scout can outmaneuver a soldier entirely
21:39 < CertifiedPyro> though they said they're making some big changes within a couple of days
21:39 < battlecode426> kk
21:39 < Valid_> I mean then nerf movement, not attacks
21:39 < Valid_> Or just write something thatll predict their next direction
21:39 < CertifiedPyro> battlecode426 maybe they can outmaneuver one, but not several with triad or pentad shot
21:39 < battlecode426> that could work too
21:39 < CertifiedPyro> besides, now with the new maps, lumberjacks are also quite important

21:40 < Valid_> Yeah that really caught me off guard. Need to add my lumberjack support asap
21:40 < VeniVidiVici> scouts not being able to attack would break the game
21:40 < VeniVidiVici> because then flowers are invincible
21:40 < CertifiedPyro> yeah, i literally build no lumberjacks, that's changing real fast
21:40 < VeniVidiVici> that's almost certainly not what will happen
21:41 < Robotex> its weird.. if i say plant tree at 0 radians
21:41 < Robotex> why would it plant at 90 degrees?
21:41 < CertifiedPyro> Robotex, i know why, Direction is based on the unit circle
21:41 < VeniVidiVici> direction is based on normal angles
21:41 < Robotex> operator error!

21:41 < VeniVidiVici> so 0 is positive x axis
21:41 < CertifiedPyro> so 0 radians is 0 radians on a coordinate plane
21:41 < CertifiedPyro> ^
21:41 < Robotex> so for a 6 pack of trees
21:41 < awesomelemonade> Hey - are the scrimmage ranks going to be reset
21:41 < awesomelemonade> or are they staying
21:41 < VeniVidiVici> 6 pack of trees is weird
21:42 < VeniVidiVici> you can't plant at 60 degree angles for whatever reason
21:42 < CertifiedPyro> you should be able to?
21:42 < VeniVidiVici> it only plants 4 if i try that
21:42 < Robotex> right  what angles?
21:42 < VeniVidiVici> maybe floating point error
21:42 < Robotex> for 6pack?
21:42 < Robotex> floating point error
21:42 < Robotex> has killed alot of people
21:42 < Valid_> i use toDegrees(60) and then toDegrees(60) and get opposite of that dir
21:42 < CertifiedPyro> that's really weird veni, use radians directly

21:43 < Robotex> what radians do you use?
21:43 < CertifiedPyro> multiple operations just increases chances of floating error screwing you over
21:43 < CertifiedPyro> do something like i * Math.PI / 3, where i is some index
21:43 < Valid_> Just go look at a radisn unit circle
21:43 < Robotex> do you guys know how FP error allowed a scud to take out a barracks  during gulf war/
21:43 < Robotex> ?
21:43 < Robotex> or take down an oil rig
21:44 < CertifiedPyro> also awesomelemonade, they haven't be reset yet, i guess not?
21:44 < VeniVidiVici> i use radians for everything
21:44 < VeniVidiVici> degrees are lame
21:44 < VeniVidiVici> i think i did 2 * Math.PI/NUM_ANGLES though so maybe there's something introduced there
21:45 < CertifiedPyro> what is num_angles for you? 6
21:45 < VeniVidiVici> yeah
21:45 < Robotex> im using an array with set radians
21:45 < Robotex> and get whacky results
21:45 < Robotex> 0 radians plants at 90 degrees
21:46 < CertifiedPyro> What I do is a for loop of i from 0 to 6, and say "Direction dir = new Direction((float) (i * Math.PI / 3)"
21:46 < CertifiedPyro> then check "rc.canBuildRobot(RobotType.SCOUT, dir)"
21:46 < VeniVidiVici> weird
21:46 < VeniVidiVici> that's basically what i do except with trees
21:46 < VeniVidiVici> and it wont' plant
21:46 < CertifiedPyro> Robotex for you, is 0 radians giving a north or east direction?
21:46 < VeniVidiVici> so i changed it to some other stuff

21:47 < battlecode419> 0 degrees to your current direction. is neither north or south
21:47 < Robotex> pyro how do i pm you?
21:47 < Robotex> for me 0 radians and 3.14159 radians are giving me 90 and 270 respectively
21:48 < CertifiedPyro> you can pm me using the "/query [name]" command
21:48 < battlecode419> you mean rotate by 0 radians makes you build at a 90 degree angle? that seems like a bug
21:48 < Robotex> im testing now
21:49 < Robotex> so here is the code
21:49 < Robotex> if(rc.hasTreeBuildRequirements()){ 				if(rc.canPlantTree(m)){ 					rc.plantTree(m); 					Clock.yield();
21:49 < Robotex> m comes from an Direction[]
21:49 < Robotex> 2 direction values, 0 and 3.14159
21:49 < Robotex> output 2 trees at 90 and 180 respectively
21:50 < battlecode419> hmm should be 0 and 180
21:50 < CertifiedPyro> robotex, which cardinal direction are they planting in (eg. north, east, etc)?
21:50 < Robotex> east and west
21:50 < CertifiedPyro> that's correct
21:50 < Robotex> sorry i misspoke
21:51 < Robotex> 270 and 90
21:51 < Robotex> for 0 radians?
21:51 < battlecode419> east and west are at 180 degre angle
21:51 < Robotex> hmm
21:51 < Robotex> so 0 degrees is not north?
21:51 < battlecode419> east and west is expected behavior
21:51 < battlecode419> no 0 degress is not anything
21:51 < Robotex> what about 0 radians?
21:51 < battlecode419> the degree is always relative

21:51 < battlecode419> to your position
21:51 < CertifiedPyro> 0 degrees/0 radians is east because unit circle
21:51 < Robotex> ohhh
21:51 < VeniVidiVici> angles are always relative to positive x
21:51 < battlecode419> that is true in math
21:52 < battlecode419> not here
21:52 < VeniVidiVici> ?
21:52 < Robotex> well in real world mapping 0 is always north
21:52 < CertifiedPyro> degrees are not relative to position, it's always the same

21:52 < Robotex> (mostly)
21:52 < Robotex> on a map though degrees are how one communicates direction
21:52 < Robotex> so thats my concept error
21:52 < battlecode419> hmm maybe that's true then. i was under the impression that you keep direction but you prob dont
21:52 < Robotex> i assumed degrees / radians converted to cardinal directions,.
21:52 < battlecode419> then 0 is east
21:53 < VeniVidiVici> @pyro: positive x isn't affected by your position
21:53 < CertifiedPyro> yeah, that's what i'm saying
21:53 < Robotex> so how do i make sure a tree is planted NE?
21:53 < VeniVidiVici> pi/4
21:53 < CertifiedPyro> robotex, in the API, the constructor says it's based on the unit circle
21:53 < CertifiedPyro> https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/unit-circle.html
21:54 < CertifiedPyro> so 0 radians is east, pi/2 radians is north, etc
21:54 < VeniVidiVici> or 45 degrees if you want to use those

21:55 < CertifiedPyro> east
21:55 < Robotex> but 0 radians = 0 degrees
21:55 < CertifiedPyro> yes
21:56 < Robotex> 0 degrees is traditionally North on a map
21:56 < CertifiedPyro> and on a coordinate plane, 0 degrees is on the positive x axis direction
21:56 < Robotex> ok...
21:56 < Robotex> ijust need to shift my frame of reference
21:56 < CertifiedPyro> yeah
21:56 < battlecode419> east is your new north :)
21:56 < Robotex> sorry my background is navigation.
21:57 < CertifiedPyro> just think in terms of the coordinate plane when dealing with directions and angles. it's a little confusing, but you'll get used to it

22:27 < CertifiedPyro> so they don't want you to horde them, but donate them over time
22:27 < The_Duck> I like those unit stat changes
22:27 < The_Duck> are they fixing bullet turn order?
22:27 < CertifiedPyro> also, accessing enemy vp brings some new strats in too
22:27 < CertifiedPyro> The_Duck pretty sure that's slated for release too
22:28 < The_Duck> oh yeah https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode-server/pull/415
22:28 < VeniVidiVici> whoa whoa whoa
22:28 < VeniVidiVici> broadcast 1000 -> 10000 is not a minor change lol
22:28 < tfk> oh
22:29 < gongy> WHAT
22:29 < gongy> 10 HP SCOUTS
22:29 < CertifiedPyro> yeah
22:29 < gongy> dude gg meta
22:29 < VeniVidiVici> wow scouts just got crapped on
22:29 < tfk> bullet turn order change
22:29 < tfk> might fix scouts too
22:29 < CertifiedPyro> at least they're faster now (since everything's slower)
22:29 < VeniVidiVici> this is a completely new game now
22:29 < gongy> nah tfk that doesn't "fix" scouts
22:29 < gongy> it just fixes the game
22:29 < CertifiedPyro> but they hit like wet noodles now
22:29 < gongy> scouts didn't rely on the turn order thing
22:29 < tfk> bullets advance immediately after the turn of the robot that fired them now right?
22:29 < The_Duck> so bullets will go just before their firing robot in the turn order. So it will be very easy to dodge things
22:29 < The_Duck> if I understand right
22:29 < The_Duck> everyone will get a chance to dodge before the bullet moves
22:30 < The_Duck> could get a little silly; two adjacent soldiers or scouts won't be able to touch each other I think
22:33 < CertifiedPyro> tanks are even powerful now now
22:33 < CertifiedPyro> two bullets from tank = dead scout
22:33 < CertifiedPyro> plus body attack has almost same damage as lumberjack chop
22:33 < CertifiedPyro> tank rush might actually become a thing now
22:33 < VeniVidiVici> yeah tanks might actually be meta now
22:33  * Hjax has been building tanks since day 1
22:33 < CertifiedPyro> well, some combination of lumberjacks + tanks would probably be pretty powerful
22:33 < tfk> lots more broadcast channels
22:33  * Hjax already goes lumberjack tank 
22:33 < tfk> wonder why they changed it to 1k to begin with?
22:33 < CertifiedPyro> to make it harder to spam broadcasts i guess?
22:33 < VeniVidiVici> aaaaand welcome to the turtlte meta
22:33 < tfk> time for tank corners
22:33 < tfk> followed by full map barrage
22:33 < VeniVidiVici> build one tank and a farm
22:33 < VeniVidiVici> just win vp
22:33 < VeniVidiVici> might be a valid strat now
22:33 < Hjax> in previous years it was 2^16 channels
22:33 < u___> these changes swing too far IMO
22:33 < u___> scout attack -> 0.5 suffices
22:33 < tfk> idk
22:33 < tfk> I kinda wish they had just changed its speed
22:33 < u___> unless you have really bad micro and can't move out of the way at all
22:33 < tfk> or made it bigger
22:33 < VeniVidiVici> the problem is scout nerfs are turtle buffs
22:33 < CertifiedPyro> well, looks like scouts aren't taking out archons or tanks anytime soon
22:33 < VeniVidiVici> and turtling is boring
22:33 < tfk> it can still dodge like a mother
22:33 < zxqfl> imo it's good that scouts can still kill gardeners
22:33 < CertifiedPyro> yeah true
22:33 < u___> victory point cost is interesting
22:33 < VeniVidiVici> yes absolutely
22:33 < zxqfl> they were needed to keep hexes/squares in check
22:33 < u___> it forces you to choose, i guess
22:33 < VeniVidiVici> but now it takes forever
22:33 < tfk> doubling # of turns to do that is pretty big though
22:33 < VeniVidiVici> like straight up hexaturtling isn't even all that bad anymore
22:33 < tfk> now a gardener won't die before its tree grows or something
22:33 < gongy> think so?
22:33 < gongy> the other changes definitely fix scouts tho
22:33 < gongy> rip scouts
22:34 < u___> actually no
22:34 < tfk> oh is that it duck?
22:34 < tfk> I thought it was after
22:34 < u___> well hm
22:34 < u___> The_Duck: yeah, i noticed that too
22:34 < CertifiedPyro> pull request looks like bullet moves before its firing robot
22:34 < u___> The_Duck: forces you to use armies + burst fire to make any progress attacking
22:34 < tfk> yea duck is right
22:34 < u___> The_Duck: which might be good
22:35 < u___> but they also made soldiers and lumbers slightly slower
22:35 < CertifiedPyro> well, sprint tournament results are basically void, lots of stuff's changing now
22:35 < u___> bullet speed 2 vs movement speed 1.75, if you spray, it's not that easy to dodge
22:35 < tfk> unless you are a scout
22:35 < u___> well scouts could always dodge perfecetly
22:35 < u___> hmm
22:35 < CertifiedPyro> it's hard for scouts to dodge tank bullets though
22:36 < CertifiedPyro> those things move at 4 speed, scouts still move 2.5
22:36 < u___> the tank buff is pretty extreme considering there are all these maps where you get a free tank
22:36 < u___> from chopping
22:36 < u___> or shrine with 1 tank in the center
22:36 < CertifiedPyro> yeah, that's a little concerning
22:37 < VeniVidiVici> oh yeah good point
22:37 < Hjax> so im really confused why they think tank buffs are necessary
22:37 < Hjax> i thought they were already strong
22:37 -!- dinosaurs [48dbcf77@gateway/web/cgi-irc/kiwiirc.com/ip.72.219.207.119] has joined #battlecode
22:37 < u___> yeah
22:37 < tfk> they are easy to hit though
22:37 < VeniVidiVici> i thought tanks were fine
22:37 < CertifiedPyro> i mean, scout's main purpose now is to maybe kill gardeners early one still, but later on, they can only scout
22:37 < Hjax> the problem was most peoples economy tended to be too gimped to build them
22:37 < u___> tanks were already good, it's just people didn't bother with them because of pathing issues
22:37 < Hjax> since scouts killed economies too well
22:37 -!- rabbott [~Ryan@209.2.216.217] has joined #battlecode
22:37 < zxqfl> ^
22:37 < u___> they're bulky and the decision to build a tank is a hard one to figure out
22:37 < VeniVidiVici> people weren't building them because games weren't lasting long enough
22:37 < zxqfl> it was hard to know how good tanks were
22:38 < u___> but they were good if you had them
22:38 < Hjax> yeah exactly VeniVidiVici
22:38 < Hjax> my team was using them to great effect in macro games
22:38 < tfk> the body attack increase
22:38 < Hjax> the problem was we were dying to the all out aggression builds
22:38 < tfk> is probably the most important buff
22:38 < CertifiedPyro> tanks are super good on large maps, but small maps?
22:38 < u___> yeah devs always aim for macro games
22:38 < u___> ofc
22:38 < CertifiedPyro> how on earth do you pathfind with them?
22:38 < Hjax> CertifiedPyro: you just build extra lumberjacks
22:38 < tfk> if they didn't have body attack
22:38 < CertifiedPyro> or bodyattack your way out i guess
22:38 < tfk> you could just use your regular pathing algorithm
22:38 < tfk> lol
22:38 < CertifiedPyro> i assume body attack is still only one tree?
22:39 < u___> dinosaurs: have you thought about making growth more linear early game, i.e. reducing tree income relative to base income?

22:40 < VeniVidiVici> well those are necessary changes
22:40 < VeniVidiVici> otherwise turtling would be too fast
22:40 < u___> vp changes make the turtle meta interesting i guess
22:41 < VeniVidiVici> turtles won in like 700-800 turns if uncontested
22:41 < VeniVidiVici> and with these changes that's faster than anything else can happen
22:41 < u___> actually yeah 5 is too cheap
22:41 < VeniVidiVici> i feel like turtling is gonna b e athing now

22:41 -!- rabbott [~Ryan@209.2.216.217] has quit [Client Quit]
22:41 < CertifiedPyro> i think it's going to be turtle early -> attack late game?
22:41 < tfk> yea actually I like these scout changes
22:41 < CertifiedPyro> the early vp exchange rate is too good to pass up
22:42 < tfk> killing a gardener is now equal cost to building it
22:42 < tfk> by a scout
22:42 < tfk> which should help a lot
22:42 < VeniVidiVici> tbh i think people are just gonna build a couple units at the start of the game and then build a farm
22:42 < CertifiedPyro> oh, that's true
22:42 < u___> CertifiedPyro: no... it'll be turtle early -> win, because attacking is too costly in terms of bullets
22:42 < VeniVidiVici> attacking seems -ev
22:42 < zxqfl> tfk isn't it still 20 bullets profit for the scout?
22:42 < VeniVidiVici> like build a couple lumberjacks to not get stuck
22:42 < VeniVidiVici> build like one tank to defend
22:42 < Hjax> zxqfl is correct tfk
22:42 < tfk> oh I'm being foolish
22:42 < VeniVidiVici> and have at it with farm
22:42 < tfk> yes you're right
22:42 < tfk> 40 hp not 50
22:42 < Hjax> i dont think you can actually stop bots that try to rush VP win on maps like barrier now
22:42 < VeniVidiVici> ^
22:43 < Hjax> scouts cant stop it, and no way you are breaking through in time
22:43 < Hjax> welp, time to detect barrier and VP rush
22:43 < VeniVidiVici> lumberjacks way up in value now
22:43 < u___> eh if you go pure lumberjacks you might.. kind of... if they dont have good micro
22:43 < u___> but yeah
22:43 < VeniVidiVici> but yeah scoutrushing should be basically dead now
22:43 < CertifiedPyro> i don't know about way up. soldiers can still kite lumberjacks
22:44 < u___> https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode-server/pull/423 LOL
22:44 < VeniVidiVici> yeah but they're needed to beat turtles
22:44 < VeniVidiVici> rps meta mayb
22:44 < u___> Currently, this PR would just make the scout shoot bullets that move backwards and deal negative damage :P
22:44 < VeniVidiVici> lumberjack flood vs. turtle vs. soldier army
22:44 < CertifiedPyro> hey, don't forget tank army
22:44 < tfk> haha
22:44 < tfk> that's hilarious
22:44 < VeniVidiVici> yeah soldier/tank army
22:45 < VeniVidiVici> i guess that's a respectable meta
22:45 < CertifiedPyro> we'll see how it develops
22:45 < CertifiedPyro> i need to change everything now though

23:17 < kodomodo> is that your pinging code?

23:17 < Hjax> kodomodo: part of it that i wrote 2 minutes ago and havent tested yet
23:18 < Hjax> the idea being if a scout finds a unit too far away from all existing pings, create a new ping
23:18 < kodomodo> that's actually pretty nice, the break thing I mean. otherwise you would have to create a boolean and check that

23:31 < Hjax> the tank bot would win every single game

23:31 < Hjax> no one else seemed to though
23:31 < zxqfl> interesting
23:31 < zxqfl> the main difficulty for us was getting them to pathfind through our hex trees
23:32 < zxqfl> that and the meta making early micro more important
23:32 < Hjax> zxqfl: but your gardener code / tree grid makes our economy look like a joke

23:33 < zxqfl> i saw wcgw had some nice tree plantations as well
23:33 < kodomodo> did you both do the spaced out tree thing?

01:06 < VeniVidiVici> we do probably the same thing
01:06 < VeniVidiVici> it's more of a placeholder than an actual system though
01:06 < CertifiedPyro> you basically find the shortest distance between you and the line that a bullet makes when it travels, and that distance is related the "force" pushing the bullet away from the line
01:06 < CertifiedPyro> it works alright, but it struggles near map edges
01:07 < CertifiedPyro> so you'll have to probably add an extra force or two there
01:07 < battlecode277> What if you also make the walls exert a force?
01:07 < CertifiedPyro> i'll probably try that soon, i didn't have time to implement it before the sprint tournament
01:07 < CertifiedPyro> of course, considering trees around you is also quite important
01:07 < battlecode277> yeah

01:08 < battlecode439> I assume trees have an attractive force on scouts?
01:09 < CertifiedPyro> no, i just check if the scout can move into a tree before considering bullet dodging
01:09 < battlecode439> hmmm
01:10 < battlecode439> Do you move perpendicular to bullets? I think in some cases, that might work better than moving directly away from them.
01:10 < CertifiedPyro> yeah, it always moves perpendicular to the bullet's line of fire. determining which side to move on isn't taht hard
01:11 < CertifiedPyro> basically store the current location, and for each bullet, move that location based on the forces. the final location is the one you should move to
01:11 < battlecode439> interesting
01:13 -!- u___ [~u_@s-24-30.flex.volo.net] has joined #battlecode
01:13 < CertifiedPyro> you can experiment with how distance relates to the force. currently i do SOME_CONST - dist, but there's probably other relationships (like inverse, etc)
01:14 < battlecode439> When in combat, does bullet evasion dominate your moves, or do you also consider objectives (like getting closer to a scout)
01:14 < battlecode439> It might also be interesting to try inverse square

01:14 < battlecode439> like  coulombic forces
01:14 < CertifiedPyro> currently i consider objectives only, then if i can't find a target, i only consider bullet dodging
01:15 < battlecode439> interesting

01:53 < CertifiedPyro> just wondering, how are you guys handling when your archon and an enemy archon are spawned close to each other (like the map "cramped")?
01:57 < VeniVidiVici> we don't care
01:57 < VeniVidiVici> we do the same thing
01:57 < CertifiedPyro> ah, ok
01:58 < CertifiedPyro> i'm also trying to figure out how to manage multiple archons (make one do all the work, or spread it out)
01:58 < VeniVidiVici> judging from the classic game better teams are electing a leader
01:58 < VeniVidiVici> ours doesn't care at all

10:33 < ashdnazg> econ only probably not, but it makes trees weirdly less useful
10:33 < ashdnazg> very interesting change
10:34 < ashdnazg> I'm a grand believer in throwing all on aggressiveness
10:34 < ashdnazg> VPs are basically a timer
10:34 < timdine__> Less useful as in you'd have to build more of them to get the same vp since there is a limit to how quick you can build them even in open space?
10:35 < ashdnazg> no, as in trees take time until they give bullets and when they repay themselves, bullets cost less in VP than they did
10:35 < ashdnazg> so

10:37 -!- btiberi [~bovardtib@c-71-63-231-164.hsd1.or.comcast.net] has joined #battlecode
10:38 < timdine__> early in the game they'd repay quicker than before at 5 bullets/vp than later at 20/vp wouldn't they.  Most games didn't last until the end of rounds though I suppose.  Maybe paying 20/vp only matters significantly for that last gasp tie breaker vs someone who spends a few early.
10:40 < timdine__> I mostly learned watching the scrim that not building any lumberjacks was a BIG fail.  They're king.  It seemed the tournament maps were a lot more about limiting initial space than the scrim maps were, you didn't need lumberjacks in those.
10:40 < hatter> is this new spec?

10:49 < timdine__> I think in those specific maps a lack of lumberjacks hurt people.  Lots of people stuck in a block with no way to chop out.
10:50 < ashdnazg> yes
10:50 < timdine__> That is high on my list of additions, some strategy to determine there isn't space, build some jacks, chop some space.

10:50 < timdine__> instead of lumberjacks, who needs those
10:50 < ashdnazg> we had it, but we weren't the least bit prepared for the avalanche and chess maps
10:51 < ashdnazg> lumberjacks << jacks
10:51 < timdine__> I didn't expect the early maps to be so small either, that was a suprise to me.
10:52 < ashdnazg> I expected large maze-ish maps
10:52 < timdine__> Same, more like the wave map.

14:11 < RattatasPokeball> But on the flip side if you're close enough the bullet will hit before the robot can move, I believe
14:12 < RattatasPokeball> The end result is that scouts can no longer run away from a spray
14:12 < hatter> no lnger?
14:12 < RattatasPokeball> 10HP in particular means that solders can instakill scouts
14:12 < hatter> anything changed?
14:13 < RattatasPokeball> with one attack at point-blank range
14:13 < RattatasPokeball> and the attack will hit BEFORE the scout can move
14:13 < hatter> scout is faster so soldier cant get close

15:21 < aj604> Im getting a problem where my gardeners are only running every 2nd turn
15:22 < aj604> any idea what could cause that? Says bytecode use for the turn is 18 and doesnt print the system message at start of try loop
15:23 < hatter> more than 10k bytecode
15:23 < hatter> 18 is for second turn
15:23 < Leucosia> aj604: before the Clock.yield, check to see if the current round (according to a variable in your code) is equal to rc.getRoundNum
15:23 < Leucosia> if it isn't the same, you went over bytecode

15:24 < aj604> hmm in the client it says im nowhere near limit
15:25 < Leucosia> right - the bytecode gets reset between rounds - so if you go over during round 34, round 35 picks up where you left off and runs until it sees Clock.yield
15:25 < aj604> yea

15:30 < aj604> but no console output on even# rounds
15:30 < Leucosia> when you run a match and you click on a gardener, you can see that he uses ~1000 bytecode on the round where that doesn't print?

16:14 < ashdnazg> being a bluff would amuse me much more than merge :D
16:15 < battlecode139> should make scouts easier to deal with at least
16:15 < ashdnazg> if by "easier to deal with" you mean "not cost effective" then yes

16:17 < battlecode179> Can anyone link the git with the new patch?
16:19 < apfel> question: IDs are unique, but is it possible that a robot can have the same ID as a robot who's already been destroyed? e.g. there's a robot with ID 10, who gets killed. can a new robot get the ID 10, or does the game never assign the same ID twice?
16:20 < SaveVMK> That would be an interesting thing to exploit. But any team that can make *that many* robots can certainly win on VP beforehand.

17:08 < tfk> nice
17:08 < tfk> the stride radius change
17:08 < tfk> is good
17:08 < tfk> just saw it
17:08 < tfk> victory points still seems broken though
17:09 < VeniVidiVici> don't see the point of the stride radius thing
17:09 < tfk> should test it on big maps with aggressive gardener expansion.
17:09 < tfk> Well big thing was to make scouts not invincible
17:09 < tfk> or nigh invincible
17:09 < tfk> and cutting stride radius of all units (including scouts) does that
17:10 < tfk> it also makes units more valuable
17:10 < tfk> and 1v1 soldier combat
17:10 < tfk> different, not sure if its more or less interesting
17:11 < tfk> but now on big maps

17:11 < tfk> like 100x100 and start in corner
17:11 < tfk> you might be able to win by round 300 or something
17:11 < tfk> with victory point strategy
17:11 < tfk> since this almost doubles victory point gain in early rounds
17:11 < tfk> and before you could victory point win by like round 600
17:11 < tfk> (I didn't work out math, just going off what I've seen in my own test matches)
17:12 < tfk> it might not translate to half the turns, though, due to exponential growth in bullet production
17:12 < tfk> idk, I'm sure devs are checking this

17:19 < tfk> I wouldn't have known to be worried about it
17:19 < tfk> lol

17:22 < tfk> main thing is if they can win on big maps before enemy can reach them
17:22 < tfk> on small maps with barriers
17:22 < battlecode050> what's the turtle strat you guys are talking about?
17:22 < tfk> you could argue its the job of the bot to detect the barrier
17:23 < tfk> @battlecode050 I'm just talking about bots that do nothing but build gardeners and trees
17:23 < battlecode050> I see
17:23 < tfk> and whether spec changes make them viable on a much larger set of maps
17:23 < battlecode050> i see, cause bullets early on are cheaper
17:24 < battlecode050> I don't think that's a very viable strat
17:24 < tfk> I think that it doesn't actually cut # of rounds to win in half
17:24 < tfk> even though victory point cost starts at half off
17:24 < tfk> due to exponential bullet gain rate
17:24 < tfk> so it might not change things all that much
17:24 < battlecode050> yeah it's much harder to get bullets early on too

17:27 < oak> also, enemy team can see where you broadcast and your starting position, so they have hints to know where you are
17:27 < tfk> so there is actually still a concern maybe
17:27 < battlecode050> yeah it's not like last year where turtle was OP
17:27 < tfk> with how many hives you can setup
17:27 < tfk> (full hives)
17:27 < tfk> before enemy reaches you
17:28 < battlecode050> interesting
17:28 < tfk> eh no its fine
17:29 < tfk> I think victory point change might not change things as much as people think
17:29 < tfk> or at least as *I* initially thought
17:29 < battlecode050> the max map size is only 100x100
17:29 < battlecode050> anyone know what's for dinner though?
17:30 < VeniVidiVici> idk i feel like there are going to be maps where turtling is just unbeatable
17:30 < VeniVidiVici> like on barrier you already need at least ~300 turns to break the wall
17:31 < VeniVidiVici> and by then enemy has 600 vp and several flowers
17:31 < Leucosia> wouldn't part of the strategy be to determine when turtling will win and then to have the best econ?
17:31 < Leucosia> and also be able to know when to mix offense and econ or just hard offense
17:31 < VeniVidiVici> yeah but my issue with that is
17:31 < VeniVidiVici> some rando who just turtles every map
17:31 < VeniVidiVici> could randomly beat a top team who actually scouts the map out first
17:32 < VeniVidiVici> in small elims that means nonsense can happen
17:32 < VeniVidiVici> i'm probably overestimating how hard the scout nerfs are though
17:32 < battlecode050> that's basically what happened last year
17:32 < VeniVidiVici> they could still totally be strong enough to clear out turtles
17:33 < Leucosia> wish we knew when the patch will happen
17:33 < battlecode050> they already sent the pull request but it's not merged yet with the server
17:34 < battlecode050> they did that last night actually

17:37 < battlecode050> what team are you veni?
17:37 < battlecode139> agreed that plain victory point rushes could be very deadly, it already was scary on maps like brrier
17:37 < matthewpipie> can anyone help me run the game?  after a successful gradle build (windows btw) running Battlecode Client.exe does nothing, and if I run it in a command prompt, i get this: http://pastebin.com/raw/jRuKhLgP
17:37 < battlecode139> and enclosure to some degree
17:37 < battlecode139> add slower movement
17:38 < battlecode139> and the best strat on those big maps with a lot of space may be to just ignore everything but gardeners/trees
17:38 -!- u___ [~u_@s-24-30.flex.volo.net] has joined #battlecode

17:40 < Leucosia> matthewpipie: not sure about that error - I'd check on http://www.battlecodeforum.org in the Troubleshooting + FAQ post
17:40 < battlecode139> ouch
17:40 < battlecode139> gardener/soldier meta incoming
17:40 < battlecode050> yeah, I think that's a mistake, early scouts were defendable
17:40 < battlecode139> they were definitly too good, but the movement nerf alone mightve been enough
17:40 < matthewpipie> could it be because im running jdk 1.8.0_66?
17:42 < battlecode139> probably still worth having a scout or two up to pick off stragglers and shake trees
17:43 < battlecode050> yeah scouts are really just scouts now
17:43 < u___> stride radius cut in half!!!

17:44 < battlecode139> just hope we wont see vp games dominating, such a boring mechanic comapratively
17:44 < u___> battlecode139: yeah i'm assuming with this change VP costs will also go up
17:45 < u___> they'l realize fairly quickly anyway
17:45 < u___> half the VP cost + twice as long to walk to the enemy = lol
17:45 < battlecode139> i hope so
17:45 < battlecode139> and socuts cant kill gardeners nearly as quickly
17:45 < u___> i mean look
17:45 < battlecode139> and units still wont really be able to break tree walls
17:45 < u___> unmolested you can win with VP at turn 1000
17:46 < u___> and turn 1000 is when the new scaling VP cost increases to 10
17:46 < u___> cause 5->20, 1/3 of the way there
17:46 < u___> so yeah ultra easy
17:46 < battlecode139> its much faster than 1000 on some mps
17:47 < u___> oh well its 1000 for me cause i build tons of paranoid lumberjacks to defend
17:47 < Hjax> i had a bot that could victory point win in like 600 rounds in the old system
17:47 < u___> it can super fast if you're pure greed yeah
17:47 < Hjax> it will be like 400 or less now
17:47 < Hjax> gl winning on barrier
17:47 < battlecode139> my only match loss in the last few days was already  vp rusher who build nothing but gardeners :P
17:47 < u___> lol i literally think it should be 20->40 or something
17:47 < u___> or ehh
17:47 < u___> idk if it should scale up at all
17:47 < battlecode139> they won turn 674 on barrier
17:47 < u___> i don't see how the scaling helps
17:48 < battlecode139> its somewhat interesting i guess

17:49 < battlecode139> its not really a fun mechanic
17:49 < kodomodo> scouts will still be able to pick of gardeners, albeit slowly

19:07 < VeniVidiVici> @valid_ no it can only move once a turn
19:07 < VeniVidiVici> any distance
19:07 < Valid_> Ok so that rules out my initial idea lmao
19:07 < Valid_> They suddenly dont wanna hide in trees oddly enough
19:09 < Cactus> When the next tournament? Is it the seeding tournament?
19:09 < CertifiedPyro> yes
19:09 < CertifiedPyro> it's sometime next week
19:10 < Leucosia> hmmm... devs just said that bytecode will be changing a bit too - not set in stone as to how, but will have an incentive to use less and the ability to use more
19:10 < CertifiedPyro> hmm...that sounds interesting
19:10 < CertifiedPyro> wonder how they'll pull that off
19:12 < VeniVidiVici> what
19:13 < Leucosia> no more info that that - they have moved on in the lecture
19:13 < VeniVidiVici> does game normally completely change after sprint
19:13 < Valid_> These scout changes will destroy many peoples entire strats lmao
19:13 < Leucosia> yes, but I'm a first timer so I don't know if they usually change it this much
19:15 < nmccoy-dev> There are often significant game changes after the sprint tournament. The drones of 2015 are very similar to the situation here (overpowered scout unit that can go over obstacles and attack in a rush at the start. Apparently we never learn)
19:16 < ir0x539_> this is so standard
19:16 < ir0x539_> every sprint some light unit is OP
19:16 < ir0x539_> then they nerf it into theground
19:16 < XSquare> I thought the op scouts were done on purpose

19:17 < VeniVidiVici> interesting
19:18 < ir0x539_> its all good, imo the good teams always have great matches
19:19 < Valid_> Baha i spent over 4 hours trying to figure out why my scouts dont hide in the trees anymore
19:20 < Valid_> And its because ya boi was referencing the closestEnemys location rather than the trees
19:20 < CertifiedPyro> lol
19:20 < CertifiedPyro> trying to implement "phases" for my bots in my code is getting really messy
19:20 < Valid_> Honestly i need to clean up my code. Its getting out of hand lol

19:28 < Valid_> That was my wednesday! Felt great haha
19:28 < Valid_> How was your sprint?
19:28 < ir0x539_> shrine patch marged
19:28 < Cactus> I haven't started building a bot yet. I'm in high school, but I have midterms next week, so I won't have any classes. Do I still have a shot?
19:28 < ir0x539_> maybe more incoming

19:29 < VeniVidiVici> cactus the game is largely changing soon so you won't be that behind
19:29 < ir0x539_> do eeet
19:29 < Sphinx111_> Yes Cactus, you do :D plus it will give you a better shot for next year too :D
19:29 < Cactus> I figured that the game will be completely different in a few days, so I won't really be wasting that much time :)
19:29 < Sphinx111_> Yeah, I made it through to the fourth round in the sprint, coming from last place in the ranked scrims, I'm proud of that :)
19:30 < Valid_> Awesome!
19:30 < Cactus> A* search seems to be boggling my mind, though . . .
19:31 < CertifiedPyro> i'm not sure if A* search is the best way to go

19:45 < globalpointer> looking forward to it :D
19:45 < zxqfl> when can we test with the new changes?

19:52 < Valid_> Wait wait the broadcasts are floats now?
19:52 < CertifiedPyro> they're allowing it now i think
19:52 < Valid_> Jesus that woulda been real nice early on
19:52 < CertifiedPyro> it was in the pull requests, not sure where it went
19:52 < Valid_> Part of me wants that. And part of me doesn't
19:52 < teamrocket> I just hope they make sure it is possible to build a bot that wins. When they give you a funtion for everything it will be a game of luck
19:52 < nmccoy-dev> That's something separate, we just let you broadcast floats as floats if you want
19:52 < nmccoy-dev> If you don't want to use that, nothing's changed
19:53 < zxqfl> Valid_ if the change matches the description of the pull request, sensing/dodging bullets will be easier
19:53 < nmccoy-dev> For execution order, this shouldn't affect what your robots need to do. It just makes combat slightly more fair.
19:53 < Valid_> alright thanks!
19:54 < nmccoy-dev> Previously, later-spawned robots had an advantage because their bullets would be spawned after other robots had moved, and other robots wouldn't get a chance to dodge the bullet before it moves
19:54 < ir0x539_> im still confused about the order of everything in the round, is this going to be rewritten in the spec?
19:54 < teamrocket> And finding out who moved before you and who not was a challenge

19:55 < zxqfl> we too assumed it was a built-in quirk of the system
19:55 < zxqfl> and that we were intended to build a way to exploit it
19:55 < teamrocket> Its fair because everybody can and furthermore we even worked on a counter
19:55 < zxqfl> but, it was pretty unfair that if two scouts both built on turn 2 fought, one would win without taking damage
19:57 < teamrocket> Iam looking forward to the patch, untill then it will be hard to figure the new meta
19:58 < Sphinx111_> Hmm, I am having a problem with a section of my code and wondering if anyone could provide a little Java knowledge...
19:58 < CertifiedPyro> what about it?
19:58 < zxqfl> sure, what's the problem?
19:58 < Valid_> Whats up
19:58 < Sphinx111_> I have an if() statement which seems to inexplicably eat 30,000+ bytecodes
19:59 < Valid_> $30 on exception
19:59 < zxqfl> can you post the if statement?
19:59 < Sphinx111_> if (float value1 == constantValue || float value2 == constantValue || float value3 == constantValue || float value4 == constantValue) {
19:59 < Sphinx111_> and the return statement is just returning "int 1" if the condition is met
20:00 < Valid_> This wont solve your problem but for future reference, floats can be imprecise so id suggest making a method which compares them to a certain degree of uncerntainty
20:00 < zxqfl> based on that your code shouldn't be taking 30k bytecodes
20:00 < Sphinx111_> all of the fields being checked are held in another class file that has the variables set to public, and both are part of the same package
20:00 < Valid_> Console is clear?
20:00 < Sphinx111_> Yep, no stacktraces being printed by my Catch block

20:02 < zxqfl> how did you determine this statement was the bottleneck?
20:03 < Valid_> Oh good question
20:03 < Sphinx111_> I placed System.out.println() lines every three or four lines in the program
20:03 < Valid_> To make sure, you can output the bytecode
20:03 < Valid_> try to run it but output the bytecode before and after

20:06 < Sphinx111_> .... yeah, I think you're right
20:06 < zxqfl> you're accessing fields, not methods, right? and this is java not scala?

20:12 < Sphinx111_> I solved it... I'm an idiot!
20:13 < Sphinx111_> The unit that has the massive bytecode overspend also does some things that aren't explicitly defined in the functions I've set up for it...
20:13 < Sphinx111_> Each unit initialises its fields as one of the first things it does when it's created
20:13 < Sphinx111_> one of these fields is a very large array...
20:15 < zxqfl> glad to hear you solved it
20:15 < Sphinx111_> it was a stupid mistake, but I'm glad I caught it
20:16 < Sphinx111_> I wonder how I didn't notice this happening in my previous versions, huh.
20:19 < Sphinx111_> Appreciate the tips on floating point comparisons though, at least I learned something new :)
20:20 < teamrocket> For initiating huge arrays '
20:21 < teamrocket> You might split them up into more than one round when the  bytecost counter is getting high

21:17 < Valid_> The first match is hilarious. The second one is aight
21:17 < Cactus> Should I try to implement A* pathfinding or will it be too many bytecodes?
21:17 < Valid_> Your micro is nice, my scouts had some bugs but once i push out i wanna rematch! You got me that time!
21:17 < Cactus> Should I do some bug-like thing instead?
21:17 < Valid_> Do bug
21:17 < Cactus> With modifications, or . . .?
21:17 < Valid_> A* is intensive and youd really have to work on it for the continuous map
21:17 < Valid_> well ofc
21:17 < Valid_> make whatever mods you feel are needed for your stuff i suppose
21:18 < Cactus> What's ofc?
21:18 < Valid_> of course
21:18 < Cactus> Oh . . . (facepalm)
21:18 < Robotex> interesting Hjax i cant see them atch
21:18 < Valid_> Robotex:  what team are you?
21:18 < Robotex> Legio IX
21:18 < Cactus> I thought it was an acronym like bfs or dfs :)

21:37 < Cactus> That guy uses breadth-first
21:37 < Cactus> So maybe it IS possible
21:37 < Cactus> idk
21:38 < Cactus> "I implemented bug, but I didn't want to rely on it. So my main pathfinding algorithm was breadth-first search. In this algorithm you work backward from the destination, finding optimal routes to that destination from every square on the map. Once you work backward to your current location, you start following the computed route.  This has two problems. First, it takes a lot of bytecodes. It can take hundreds of rounds to run. I 
21:38 < Valid_> I mean its a different game rn and the entire map system is different
21:38 < Valid_> but itd be cool if you did it
21:38 < Cactus> Wait, was it continuous before?
21:38 < Valid_> no
21:38 < Valid_> it was discrete
21:39 < Cactus> I guess that changes things.
21:39 < Cactus> Whatever. Maybe I'll try it. I still think combat micros are more important. Most important, even.

22:08 < teamrocket> .
22:09 < battlecode284> so what happened to the subway sandwiches?
22:09 < battlecode050> you can make your own scout rush bot to play against
22:09 < battlecode050> but yeah where are the sandwhichs?
22:09 < battlecode046> thanks for asking battlecode 284. we don't want to waste those 75 subs
22:10 < Hjax> robotex: does my scout rush count?
22:10 < battlecode050> kazimuth dvorak42 did you guys still get the subs?
22:10 < teamrocket> Since the game is deterministic wouldnt it be nice to see the devs release mappacks in final order, 12 hours before a tournament. Those maps ofc bee played in it. The mappacks are encrypted untill after the tournament where the key is released then.
22:11 < Hjax> teamrocket: you can just get the sprint maps from the git
22:11 < battlecode050> maybe they can encrypt it with a homomorphic encryption so that we can play the matches on the maps ourselves but they release the keys after
22:11 < Hjax> ive been testing on them since sprint
22:12 < battlecode050> actually yeah they should just homomorphically encrypt every map ever so that we can play against people and not find out who won until they decide to release the key
22:13 < battlecode050> but more importantly I'm wondering where the sandwhichs are
22:13 < Hjax> i just want the new patch TT
22:13 < CertifiedPyro> same
22:16 < teamrocket> Hmm i like the strategic element of analysing others or not giving away information. Its more about beeing not changeable after release making the result final in the moment of deadline
22:16 < battlecode284> yea were are the sandwiches hahaha
22:16 < battlecode284> im wicked hungry
22:16 < CertifiedPyro> I stole the sandwiches! Mwhahahaha
22:17 < battlecode050> teamrocket that's true, although if u can't change your bot you might as well wait for the tourney and view the game afterwards

22:19 < matthewpipie> cool thanks!
22:20 < teamrocket> I can change the bot in the 12 hours between maprelease and tournamemt without knowing the maps or beeing able to play on them. The whole purpose of the encrypted file beeing that the nature of the tournament is determined befire deadline

22:32 < battlecode050> are you guys just throwing away the sandwiches?

00:45 < robotex> wow 10K channels?
00:45 < globalpointer> like spec doesn't have the stride radius changes
00:46 < CertifiedPyro> i think it might have accidentally got reverted, top of specs says 1.2.2
00:47 < kahkeng> yeah looks like it
00:47 < CertifiedPyro> also, anyone know if support for broadcasting bools/floats was actually added? isn't showing up in API
00:48 < kahkeng> i think so, according to github, it got merged into master

00:52 < globalpointer> ... is it just bullet exchange rate?...
00:52 < VeniVidiVici> "bullets fired by a robot now get executed right after that robots turn"
00:52 < globalpointer> or did they change broadcasting?
00:52 < CertifiedPyro> use VP_BASE_COST AND VP_INCREASE_PER_ROUND
00:52 < robotex> are you guys able to run the build?
00:52 < ichaelm> I hope they meant before its turn
00:52 < VeniVidiVici> this seems important
00:52 < globalpointer> did they say they would provide a function to get the current cost?

00:53 < globalpointer> I hope they mean after its turn
00:53 < globalpointer> before its turn means infinite dodging
00:53 < VeniVidiVici> if it's after then it's huge differences
00:53 < VeniVidiVici> that might finally be the death of scouts
00:53 < VeniVidiVici> if it's before then still tons of dodging
00:53 < kahkeng> now it's broadcastInt, broadcastFloat, broadcastBoolean
00:53 < darthjarjar> why in eclipse does it still think bullet exchange rate is right :/
00:53 < globalpointer> ahh
00:53 < ichaelm> if it's after, you can't didge within a radius of the bullet's speed
00:53 < VeniVidiVici> ^
00:53 < ichaelm> if it's before, you can
00:53 < VeniVidiVici> drastically reduces scout's options if it's after
00:54 < VeniVidiVici> because you have to stay like 5 units away from everything
00:54 < robotex> have you been able to get the scaffold to update?
00:54 < ichaelm> i believe the code changes suggested it was before, not after
00:54 < VeniVidiVici> before seems more logicla
00:54 < VeniVidiVici> and closer to what's already been part of the game
00:54 < The_Duck> so soldiers have a body radius of 1 and a stride radius of 1. so they could try to dodge a bullet that will hit them next turn by moving perpendicularly. Then I guess whether they get hit will depend on floating point rounding?
00:55 < globalpointer> what I was worried about ^
00:55 < VeniVidiVici> they have a stride of 1?
00:55 < kahkeng> it's still downloading for me, 1.2MB/117MB. maybe it is still propagating on s3 and we're too eager
00:55 < VeniVidiVici> i thought 2.5/2
00:55 < ichaelm> https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode-server/commit/36bc7e6b1f0b8ff318574b8e6f819c0b15d17211
00:55 < CertifiedPyro> Oh ffs, I can't rebuild without getting rid of BULLET_EXCHANGE_RATE
00:56 < u___> The_Duck: shit that's a good point
00:56 < VeniVidiVici> wait why would it be 1
00:56 < VeniVidiVici> it used to be 2.5 and got halved right?
00:56 < The_Duck> looks like 1 here: https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode-server/commit/ce238f3e83b30f1ee99e8c349e2d88ba4715e978

00:57 < VeniVidiVici> yeah sry
00:57 < VeniVidiVici> but bullets also have a radius right
00:57 < The_Duck> I think their radius is 0

00:57 < VeniVidiVici> huh
00:57 < VeniVidiVici> for some reaosn i thought 0.01
00:57 < ichaelm> bullets are inserted before the robots that fire them, in execution order i mean
00:58 < globalpointer> it looks like it's before? so the changelog is incorrect?
00:58 < ichaelm> so every other robot gets a chance to dodge unless they're closer than the spawn distance
00:58 < VeniVidiVici> that makes more sense
00:58 < ichaelm> :D
00:58 < globalpointer> even if it's within spawn distance they can still dodge I think
00:58 < globalpointer> I don't think bullets do collision until they spawn and move
00:59 < globalpointer> *until they move
00:59 < ichaelm> really?

00:59 < robotex> so how bad did the scouts get gimped?
00:59 < globalpointer> that's what it looks like from what I can see... not 100% though
00:59 < VeniVidiVici> remains to be seen
00:59 < VeniVidiVici> but looks massive to me
00:59 < ichaelm> Does anyone know if you can dodge bullets that spawn inside you?
01:00 < ichaelm> for some reason I feel like I've seen the opposite but not sure
01:00 < globalpointer> you definitely could before the patch
01:00 < globalpointer> and I think they would have said if they'd noticed and changed it
01:00 < robotex> i think with shorter strides dodging will be harder?
01:00 < aishair> wayy harder
01:00 < VeniVidiVici> yes dodging is way harder now
01:00 < VeniVidiVici> which is good
01:00 < aishair> they really want the bullet hell to be effective
01:01 < VeniVidiVici> e.g. trishot isn't dodgeable now at close range i think
01:01 < VeniVidiVici> so scouts aren't immortal
01:01 < robotex> we can blame this all on scouts
01:02 < The_Duck> scouts are also slower than soldier bullets
01:02 < The_Duck> and scout bullets for that  matter
01:02 < globalpointer> they can still dodge sideways
01:02 < The_Duck> yeah but they can't just run away from a triad or pentad
01:04 < The_Duck> also we won't have soldiers rushing forward just behind their bullets, firing pentads and building up a bullet wall
01:04 < The_Duck> alas

01:20 < cookiemix> if you try to move to a location using move(), and you cant move there, will it try to move as close as possible?
01:20 < aishair> so does that mean its impossible to run into your own bullet as a soldier?

01:27 < Robotex> so coded my firstsoldier.  they shoot 1 triead shot then stop
01:28 < tfk> don't bullets move before robots?
01:28 < tfk> or was that changed?

01:29 < cookiemix> anybody down for scrimmage?
01:29 < CertifiedPyro> Oh, btw, the distance needed to water, shake, or chop is now a defined constant instead of stride radius, so heads up
01:30 < VeniVidiVici> just ran a match and thought i was on slowmo
01:30 < tfk> haha
01:30 < tfk> just double framerate
01:30 < tfk> just like old game

01:32 < CertifiedPyro> maybe you ran too many matches?

05:57 < battlecode966> so before nerf the plan for our team was to use the scouts to sneak around the map and see things/help with pathfinding and deciding what to shoot
05:58 < battlecode966> i think we still might do that, because it seems like if everything is half-speed, nothing is half speed? well i guess the map is bigger and bullets are faster but using scouts as "scouts" still seems like it's alright

06:01 < battlecode966> cause the update says "Water, Shake, and Chop now use INTERACTION_DIST_FROM_EDGE (1) instead of stride radius to determine whether the target tree is in range."
06:02 < battlecode966> but the canInteractWithTree function in the javadocs is defined "Tests whether there is a tree at the given location and, if so, if the tree is within one stride of this robot and can therefore be interacted with through chop(), shake(), or water()."

08:34 < battlecode441> what's the turn order change?
08:35 < battlecode441> do bullets move immediately upon being shot, or does instanteneous ordering not apply for bullet shooting (i.e. bullet moves and then all of your code happens?)
08:36 -!- CertifiedPyro [a9e5638d@gateway/web/cgi-irc/kiwiirc.com/ip.169.229.99.141] has quit [Client Quit]
08:45 < kindle> I take it that bullets fired from your bot's last execution round runs its code (move, tests object collision, damages) before your bot's current execution round

08:48 < kodomodo> ^ that. I'm not sure what "runs its code" entails, because the order of its actions matter

08:50 < kindle> ah yes, I think it does object collision first then if it doesn't hit robots, moves then does its collision checking again
08:55 < battlecode441> so kindle, are you saying that bullets are first spawned, then every robot besides the one who fired moves, then the bullets fired move?
08:55 < ashdnazg> I don't think that's how it workd
08:55 < ashdnazg> *works
08:56 < ashdnazg> at least it didn't
08:56 < battlecode441> ashdnazg, you have tested this already?
08:57 < ashdnazg> well, yes
08:57 < ashdnazg> the tournament did
08:57 < ashdnazg> and the code says the same
08:57 < ashdnazg> bullet appears immediately
08:57 < ashdnazg> wait wait
08:57 < ashdnazg> never mind
08:58 < ashdnazg> they changed execution order
08:58 < ashdnazg> I'm a few days behind
08:58 < battlecode441> oh, i see. yea, i'm wondering how this affects things, but i'm not sure what exactly they are saying
08:58 < ashdnazg> ok
08:58 < ashdnazg> now I know what happens
08:59 < ashdnazg> when a bullet is created it is added to the execution order immediately after its owner
08:59 < kodomodo> *before
09:00 < ashdnazg> oh
09:00 < ashdnazg> yes
09:00 < ashdnazg> I read code wrong
09:00 < battlecode441> o. ok, i see now. so my interpretation above is accurate?

20:07 < Sphinx111> Back to late night bugfixing for me :)
20:07 < battlecode448> Does anyones code every randomly import an injection class?
20:07 < battlecode448> That causes you to automatically lose
20:07 < Sphinx111> My map edge compression codes don't return the right values -_-
20:08 < Sphinx111> Gonna split them up into multiple channels and save the hassle
20:09 < Sphinx111> importing an injection class? Hmm, no I haven't experienced that. What IDE are you using?
20:10 < battlecode448> Eclipse
20:10 < battlecode448> randomly my code will add an import for an injection class that causes my robotplayer to try to escape the environment
20:10 -!- gabrielsimoes [~gabrielsi@181.220.184.183] has joined #battlecode
20:10 < battlecode448> and so i automatically lose on round 2
20:11 < battlecode448> how far can units shoot?
20:12 < battlecode448> Their sight radius or their bullet radius?
20:12 < The_Duck> infinitely far
20:12 < battlecode448> right
20:12 < Sphinx111> There is no limit to how far they can shoot.
20:12 < battlecode448> but they can only shoot what they can sense
20:12 < battlecode448> so sight radius then
20:12 < The_Duck> they can shoot any time they want
20:13 < globalpointer> ... they don't shoot things
20:13 < globalpointer> they shoot in directions
20:13 < The_Duck> you could shoot across the map at a robot you only heard about because your teammate broadcast about it
20:13 < Sphinx111> They can shoot across the map in the hopes that there's something there to hit if they want to
20:13 < tfk> shoot radius is 200
20:13 < Sphinx111> wuuuut?
20:13 < The_Duck> *141
20:13 < tfk> go nuts
20:13 < tfk> ;)
20:13 < Sphinx111> is that bullet distance limit for real?
20:14 < tfk> very real
20:14 < tfk> more like 100 sqrt(2)
20:14 < Sphinx111> Thanks tfk
20:14 < tfk> I was approximating
20:14 < Sphinx111> sorry for giving false info -_-
20:14 < tfk> lol it wasn't false
20:14 < tfk> I'm just joking
20:14 < tfk> map size is 100x100
20:14 < tfk> at max
20:15 < Sphinx111> Isn't line of fire 300 units wide?
20:15 < tfk> wut?
20:15 < Sphinx111> I'm going to go and check this
20:15 < tfk> gameconstants says
20:15 < tfk> max width and max height is 100 each
20:16 < Sphinx111> Huh, good to know
20:17 < The_Duck> LineOfFire seems to be 100 units wide
20:18 < Sphinx111> Ah, my mistake then
20:18 < Sphinx111> damn, I am not on the ball here
20:18 < tfk> brain overheating

22:16 < CertifiedPyro> hello
22:17 < kodomodo> when I'm bullet dodging do I have to check only future bullet locations, or also current bullet locations?
22:17 < CertifiedPyro> depends on what you're doing. I'm considering the "line" made by the bullet's path
22:23 < battlecode108> do you all think that scout harass is dead, or do you think it still works?
22:24 < CertifiedPyro> i think the super early game scouts that hide in trees and shoot gardeners dead might still work
22:24 < CertifiedPyro> but the mid/late game scout rushes you saw are probably dead though
22:25 < CertifiedPyro> trying to kill soldiers or archons with scouts is like pelting a elephant with pebbles and hoping it dies

01:00 < Robotex> need some advice on cone of fire. How many degrees is the full cone of fire for a triad shot?  if i use the constant seems to be less than it is.  if i use constant* 3 more
01:01 < Robotex> would appreciate any help
01:01 < CertifiedPyro> the constant is the degrees between a bullet and its neighbor
01:01 < CertifiedPyro> so the triad shot has a cone of 40 degrees total
01:02 < CertifiedPyro> and pentad shot is 60 degrees
01:02 < Robotex> so its constant * 3 for triad for the cone correct?
01:02 < CertifiedPyro> it should be constant*2 for the triad
01:02 < Robotex> ok... thanks
01:03 < CertifiedPyro> np :)
01:03 < Robotex> math is merciless!

14:00 < kodomodo> I'll just check back in 30 minutes lol
14:07 < Hjax> kodomodo: people seem to be copying bruteforcers style from sprint
14:07 < Hjax> just straight rushdown builds
14:09 < kodomodo> all my scrims that passed "queued(#n)" are now saying "enqueued" and not running at all
14:10 < kodomodo> @Hjax can you send me a scrim and see if it completes?
14:12 < Hjax> kodomodo: i accepted like 10 scrims an hour ago
14:12 < Hjax> 5 of them have run
14:12 < Hjax> the queue is just that bad
14:12 < kodomodo> oh
14:12 < kodomodo> I guess I'll wait like 5 hours for half of mine to complete
14:13 < kodomodo> idk why it has the "queued" countdown, then, if it's not accurate
14:26 < battlecode695> also what is the date for seeding? like an actual date
14:26 < battlecode695> can a dev respond to this? there are barely any days left

14:45 < battlecode744> Im guessing this is due to the beauty of floating magic
14:45 < battlecode744> But man that's annoying
14:49 < Hjax> kodomodo: i just walked across campus, got lunch, came back
14:49 < Hjax> and our match is still in the queue
14:50 < Leucosia> @battlecode744 - could the final location be off map but returning an error that doesn't sound like that?

14:55 < kodomodo> nice
14:55 < kodomodo> what team
14:55 < Hjax> #25 When I'm GM
14:57 < kodomodo> TANKS
14:58 < Hjax> tanks are good
14:59 < Hjax> kodomodo: are you sending out mass unranked scrims?
15:00 < kodomodo> not anymore
15:00 < Hjax> lol
15:00 < Hjax> you arent the only team
15:00 < kodomodo> I regret that decision
15:00 < Hjax> waterloo has a script that checks all of the boxes
15:01 < tfk> I think you learn more by accepting matches
15:01 < tfk> since folks tend to send their best maps
15:01 < Hjax> yeah
15:01 < Hjax> my team got destroyed by a rush down team
15:01 < Hjax> because the maps were the best rushdown maps
15:02 < tfk> ya
15:02 < tfk> and I got destroyed by a lumberjack team
15:02 < tfk> on the obvious map
15:02 < tfk> lol
15:02 < Hjax> LOL
15:02 < Hjax> maniples is a dumb map
15:02 < tfk> yea it really is pretty dumb
15:02 < tfk> honestly
15:02 < tfk> it just convinces me
15:02 < tfk> that lumberjacks should not be used for combat
15:02 < tfk> because even on that map
15:02 < tfk> they suck
15:02 < tfk> lol
15:03 < tfk> inb4lumber buff
15:03 < Hjax> tfk: want to scrim?
15:03 < tfk> you can send one, but I'm going to wait till tonight before accepting more matches
15:03 < Hjax> ok
15:03 < tfk> I have a big list of changes that are needed
15:03 < tfk> like: don't get stuck
15:03 < tfk> and: don't be stupid
15:03 < tfk> etc
15:04 < tfk> speaking of which does anyone have any tips on how to avoid getting stuck, particularly near the start?
15:04 < kodomodo> tfk: those are good suggestions.
15:04 < tfk> its surprisingly annoying to handle
15:04 < tfk> just like build a gardener in wrong direction
15:04 < tfk> and you can be screwed
15:05 < Hjax> tfk: so im currently working on some code the measure the tree density and passability of subdivisions of the map
15:05 < tfk> so I have code like that
15:05 < tfk> I originally was going to use it for navigation
15:05 < tfk> thing is that it doesn't help all that much
15:05 < tfk> because you need to avoid getting other units stuck too
15:05 < Hjax> use it to decide how many lumberjacks to build
15:05 < tfk> oh, ya but you might not have room to build lumberjack
15:05 < kodomodo> in the LittleForts map?
15:06 < tfk> I don't think any of the given maps are quite so bad
15:06 < Hjax> my team gets stuck on chess a lot
15:06 < tfk> you can get stuck in chess if your lumberjacks are too mission driven
15:06 < tfk> idk it seems pretty hard
15:07 < tfk> If devs give an edge case map
15:07 < tfk> I think almost everyone will fail
15:07 < tfk> lol
15:07 < Hjax> well you saw what happened to poor waterloo on digmeout right?
15:07 < Hjax> that was super unfortunate for them
15:07 < tfk> yea
15:07 < tfk> especially because their heuristic was pretty reasonable
15:07 < tfk> for a sprint bot
15:09 < tfk> also regarding "passability" another annoyance is that you can have situations where if a unit nudges itself a little bit, you can pass
15:09 < tfk> but otherwise you can't
15:09 < tfk> pass/build*
15:09 < kodomodo> ^^
15:09 < tfk> and its like not obvious how to maneuvuer units
15:09 < tfk> at least to me
15:09 < kodomodo> @tfk what team are you? I keep forgetting
15:09 < tfk> obvious things like "get out of the way"
15:09 < tfk> don't seem to work very well

18:51 < battlecode722> is it possible to make amap and start out with surplus of bullets?
18:53 < VeniVidiVici> you could probably mess around with game files and run offline i guess
18:53 < VeniVidiVici> but i doubt directly
18:54 < battlecode722> ah  i did not realize you could run the client offline?
18:55 < whaack> what was that nice kill / grep command to kill all the game daemons that someone posted?
18:57 < VeniVidiVici> gradlew --stop
18:57 < Sphinx111> You could create a map that starts with a single neutral tree stuffed with bullets right by the spawn locations
18:59 < cbrenci> when you plant a tree, is it touching the robot, or is there some buffer?
18:59 < kodomodo> the buffer is in game constants

19:13 < tfk> seems important to not waste bullets

19:23 < battlecode685> hey all
19:23 < CertifiedPyro> hello!
19:23 < battlecode685> so what happened to the subway sandwiches from friday's lecture?
19:27 < kodomodo> You ate them
19:27 < Sphinx111> I have started building a new targeting behaviour into my bots but it's not working yet... basically has three firing modes to choose from. If the current mode is proving ineffective, it choose another mode
19:27 < kodomodo> What are trying modes?
19:27 < kodomodo> *the
19:29 < battlecode685> timkaler, do you use tanks?
19:29 < battlecode685> theyre so hard to use
19:29 -!- rabbott [~Ryan@dyn-209-2-216-42.dyn.columbia.edu] has joined #battlecode
19:31 < caterpie_> i have a similar thing. My code has 8 firing modes and 13 moving modes but there are still 2 modes that don't work
19:31 < tfk> yea they are annoying to use
19:31 < CertifiedPyro> 13 moving modes? jeez
19:31 < tfk> ?
19:31 < caterpie_> 3* sorry
19:31 < battlecode181> what do you do with the tanks tim?
19:31 < CertifiedPyro> oh, lol
19:32 < tfk> smash stuff
19:32 < battlecode181> is that more efficient than a lumberjack
19:32 < Snafets> what are those modes like pentad triple and single?
19:32 < tfk> eh idk, my tanks right now are kinda useless except against myself right now
19:32 < tfk> I'm still working on it
19:33 < Snafets> do you guys think tanks are good to use?
19:33 < tfk> pretty sure they haven't determined outcome of many real matches
19:33 < battlecode181> idk they still seem really hard to use
19:33 < battlecode181> and it's impossible to dodge anything
19:33 < Snafets> my thoughprocess regarding tanks is: f*** em
19:34 < Snafets> one less class to programm

19:34 < tfk> I mean...
19:34 < tfk> do so at your own peril
19:34 < tfk> lol
19:34 < battlecode181> they also cost too much
19:34 < Snafets> for me they just copy my soldier
19:34 < Snafets> with all those buffs they probably are really good
19:34 < battlecode181> they're a late game unit if anything, but if you're rich enough in the late game to afford tanks you probably already won
19:35 < battlecode685> yea
19:35 < battlecode685> they just block all my units
19:35 < Snafets> yeah thats what im thinking go for victory before tanks
19:35 < battlecode181> same,,,
19:35 < Snafets> yeah the pathing is a nightmare for em, i already hate that i have to deal with archons

19:37 < Snafets> i hate the devs right now have to make sure my code works on all those stupid maps from sprint turney
19:38 < tfk> if # trees with lumberjacks > 100 runManipleBot
19:38 < battlecode181> yeah the sprint maps suck
19:38 < tfk> lol
19:38 < tfk> they're good
19:39 < tfk> its really hard to make maps this year
19:39 < tfk> having challenging maps given to us is good
19:39 < battlecode181> especially those troll maps that guarantee you lose if you didn't program your bot a certain way
19:39 < tfk> its always like this
19:39 < tfk> I remember one year
19:39 < Snafets> tell me about it loset because of em but i shouldn't have gone that far anyway
19:39 < tfk> all units, including archons, could clear rubble
19:39 < tfk> but you couldn't build on rubble
19:40 < tfk> and one map had archon completely surrounded by rubble
19:40 < tfk> so unless you had code to clear, if necessary, in archon code you wouldn't build anything
19:40 < tfk> it tests robustness
19:40 < Snafets> in the round i lost i build 0 units :(
19:40 < tfk> yea in round I lost
19:40 < tfk> I got hit with 2 maps
19:40 < tfk> that showed me pretty bad bugs
19:41 < tfk> better that it happen in sprint than in later tourneys
19:42 < Snafets> oh my god sprinkels sucks cause the symmetry is not rotational by 2

19:47 < Snafets> what issue
19:48 < Snafets> you should call senseBullets after you move
19:48 < Snafets> is the best advice i can give on that
19:48 < battlecode473> Im testing an avoid bullet method but depending on which robot runs its code first it will either sense the bullet this round or next

19:50 < battlecode538> unless you are going over bytecode
19:50 < battlecode473> Well its not if it has time or not. If my robot goes first and senses before the opposing robot shoots in the same round, it wont sense it
19:51 < battlecode473> I made a simple map with a soldier for each team, and since team A goes first in this case, when I try to sense, it returns none
19:52 < Snafets> yes but the opponet's bullets wont move after your robot did
19:52 < Snafets> the opponents bullets only move right befor his next turn starts

19:56 < battlecode473> Alright I have another question lol
19:56 < battlecode473> When you fire a bullet, does it only start moving the next round?
19:56 < battlecode473> or did it already travel some distance the same round you fired it
19:56 < CertifiedPyro> only moves the next round pretty sure
19:57 < Snafets> yes
19:57 < battlecode473> Ok ty.
19:57 < Snafets> but there is a small offset (it doesnt appear in your body

19:59 < battlecode473> So it appears at the radius of the robot + a tiny bit?
19:59 < CertifiedPyro> yeah, there's a gameconstant for it
20:00 < kodomodo> I think its 0.05f as of now
20:01 < battlecode473> Ok so if your robot is right up against an enemy, is it possible for the enemy to shoot and hit you in the same round because the bullet would technically be made inside of your body?
20:01 < globalpointer> no it doesn't do detection on that turn
20:01 < globalpointer> idk if it's intended though
20:01 < globalpointer> (unless I messed up my testing on that?)

22:36 < tfk> might do well

22:42 < VeniVidiVici> we auto accept unraked kodo
22:42 < VeniVidiVici> #214
22:43 < CertifiedPyro> does auto matchmaking affect rank?
22:43 < CloudSpace> I would assume so
22:45 < kodomodo> i hope so
22:45 < kamiyama> it says that the rank from the auto matchmaking is seperate
22:46 < kodomodo> " Automatic matchmaking uses a rating system separate from your normal ranked scrimmages."
22:46 < kodomodo> yep
22:46 < kodomodo> Sad.
22:46 < CertifiedPyro> really? i lost a bunch of rank for some reason, even though i only played one match
22:46 < kodomodo> did you lose said match
22:46 < CertifiedPyro> yeah
22:46 < CertifiedPyro> that person was higher in rank though

22:47 < kodomodo> you still lose some ELO, just less than if you were higher in ELO
22:47 < CloudSpace> I think what the automatic matchmaking is saying is that it will match you will people close to you based on your automatic matchmaking results. Your win/loss will still effect your normal elo
22:47 < CertifiedPyro> OH, ok
22:48 < CloudSpace> Don't quote me on that, that's just how I interpreted it

22:59 < tfk> kodomodo
22:59 < tfk> what does that mean?
22:59 < tfk> I assume the matches still effect your rating
22:59 < tfk> just the match-making probably takes unranked and ranked matches into account... or something when doing the matchmaking itself
22:59 < kodomodo> Yeah that's not clear at all
23:00 < kodomodo> That's just what I saw on the settings page
23:00 < gendelpiekel> ?? what's unclear
23:00 < gendelpiekel> it uses a separate system from normal ranked scrimmages
23:00 < gendelpiekel> and unranked scrimmages do not use a rating system
23:00 < tfk> its unclear if the matches impact your scrimmage rank
23:00 < gendelpiekel> it doesn't
23:00 < gendelpiekel> that's what separate means
23:01 < tfk> have you done matchmaking matches?
23:01 < gendelpiekel> I have not
23:01 -!- rabbott [~Ryan@dyn-209-2-216-42.dyn.columbia.edu] has joined #battlecode

23:01 < tfk> I'm not sure why you're so certain gendelpiekel
23:02 < tfk> did the devs confirm your interpretation?
23:02 < gendelpiekel> ...
23:02 < gendelpiekel> you can ask if you want
23:02 < tfk> the subtlety, which maybe you didn't consider, is that the matchmaking description could be referring to the rating system used to pair people
23:03 < tfk> But, hopefully you are right and it is a separate system --- that would be nicer in a sense

23:03 < Hjax> im pretty sure it doesnt affect your rating at all
23:03 < Hjax> and it uses a separate rating to pair people
23:04 < gendelpiekel> tfk, can you explain what you mean?
23:05 < tfk> the matchmaking system says is it pairs you with teams around your level
23:05 < kamiyama> if it did affect your rating everyone should be forced to join
23:05 < kamiyama> otherwise a team could unknowingly screw themselves over
23:05 < kamiyama> by not joining
23:05 < gendelpiekel> tfk, yes
23:06 < tfk> so its referring to a separate hidden ranking system
23:06 < gendelpiekel> yes
23:06 < gendelpiekel> I'm confused
23:06 < tfk> The "Automatic matchmaking uses a rating system separate from your normal ranked scrimmages" is ambiguous because it doesn't explain "used for"
23:06 < kamiyama> I think tfk means there's a separate ELO system used just for pairing people together
23:06 < gendelpiekel> so I'm saying the hidden ranking system used, is separate from the ranked scrimmage system used
23:07 < kamiyama> yeah, it should be I think
23:07 < tfk> If it said "does not effect your normal scrimmage rank"
23:07 < tfk> or something
23:07 < tfk> then it would be unambiguous
23:07 < gendelpiekel> ? what was the alternative interpretation?
23:07 < tfk> That the matchmaking is based on a hidden elo system that is not your ELO on the scrimmage ladder
23:08 < gendelpiekel> what how are these different things?
23:08 < gendelpiekel> " the matchmaking is based on a hidden elo system that is not your ELO on the scrimmage ladder" vs " there's a separate ELO system used just for pairing people together"
23:08 < gendelpiekel> rip I'm so confused
23:08 < tfk> the question is whether a ranked match setup via matchmaking impacts your scrimmage rank

23:09 < tfk> Ah that's nice
23:09 < tfk> how do they appear on your matches page?
23:09 < gendelpiekel> ? as in the question in whether automatic games affect both the hidden and ranked ratings? while ranked only affects ranked?
23:09 < kodomodo> with a rocket ship
23:09 < Hjax> they have a different icon next to them
23:09 < Hjax> yeah a rocket
23:09 < tfk> cool
23:09 < tfk> thanks for being a guinee pig :D
23:10 < Hjax> its a pretty nice feature
23:10 < Hjax> my team is 2-0 in auto mm matches so far
23:10 < tfk> I wonder if they're going to use that instead of scrimmage rank for seeding
23:10 < kodomodo> i signed up when I heard about it lol
23:10 < Hjax> yeah same kodomodo

23:13 < kamiyama> yeah that is true...

23:14 < tfk> (and I don't think anyone heard about it)

23:14 < kamiyama> i certainly didn't

23:14 < tfk> but probably this wed or thur
23:14 < tfk> with sub deadline the day before

23:15 < kamiyama> yeah they ordered 75 sandwiches from subway but they got pickup instead of delivery
23:16 < kamiyama> so we left lecture and waited for them to tell us when the sandwiches came
23:16 < kamiyama> but they never did
23:16 < Robotex> there is an awful lot of gruping here :)
23:16 < tfk> they tricked you
23:16 < Robotex> griping
23:16 < tfk> :D
23:16 < kamiyama> Robotex I'm still upset about the sandwiches ;(
23:17 < Robotex> haha
23:17 < kamiyama> tfk what's the bytecode change though?
23:17 < kamiyama> is there a pull request I can look at?
23:17 < tfk> I didn't look at branch very closely
23:17 < Platinuman> what's the current meta
23:17 < tfk> its something like you can spend bullets for extra bytecode
23:17 < kamiyama> what??
23:18 < tfk> idk if that change also comes with default upkeep
23:18 < VeniVidiVici> wtf
23:18 < tfk> if it did come with default upkeep its a really major change that they probably shouldn't push
23:18 < Robotex> i can see why
23:18 < kamiyama> Platinuman it's gardener rush
23:18 < kamiyama> tfk what's default upkeep?
23:18 < Robotex> they want to push the resource management piece
23:18 < Platinuman> lmao true
23:18 < tfk> like you have to spend 1 bullet
23:18 < kamiyama> for every unit you have?
23:18 < tfk> to get the 10k bytecode you previously had for free
23:18 < kamiyama> oh..............
23:18 < tfk> or you get like 2k bytecode to start with
23:19 < tfk> and spend 1 bullet to get 10k more
23:19 < tfk> idk what the specifics are --- just know there is a branch that lets you buy 10k bytecode for 1 bullet
23:19 < kamiyama> I can't see why they would do that
23:19 < tfk> a soft bytecode limit is somewhat interesting
23:19 < Robotex> 10K for one bullet?
23:20 < Robotex> does not seem like much
23:20 < tfk> but if it comes with upkeep, holy moly would it cause a lot of changes
23:20 < tfk> the branch is just being tested
23:20 < battlecode685> yea, but I am also curious about what happened to the sandwiches
23:20 < tfk> I'm sure the 10k thing is just a placeholder
23:20 < tfk> (well I'm not sure, but its possibly just a placeholder)
23:20 < kamiyama> that's pretty crazy
23:20 < kamiyama> I think that would just make the game harder, not necessarily more interesting
23:21 < tfk> if it didn't come with upkeep
23:21 < tfk> I think it wouldn't change all that much
23:21 < battlecode685> almost as crazy as wasting 75 sandwiches, if they dumped them....
23:21 < tfk> were the sandwitches today?
23:21 < kamiyama> nah they were like 3 days ago
23:22 < kamiyama> but it's still saddening
23:22 < tfk> you must be *really* hungry
23:22 < battlecode685> nah, on friday lecture there were hella sandwiches not delivered
23:22 < tfk> 3 days
23:22 < tfk> wow
23:22 < battlecode685> im just very curious @devs
23:22 < kamiyama> I'm too poor to afford food so I just live on the free dinners
23:22 < tfk> send them an email
23:22 < tfk> it might distract them enough to prevent pushing any bytecode mechnaic changes ;)
23:22 < kamiyama> lol good, we just need to prevent that from happening
23:22 < tfk> nah don't do that
23:23 < battlecode685> i asked them to deliver the sandwiches to maseeh but i checked the lobby every 10 minutes for the entire night and never saw any sandwiches arrive
23:23 < kamiyama> I can't believe the devs would make a change like that
23:23 < Platinuman> can I get a bytecode coupon
23:23 < kamiyama> or even consider it
23:23 < Robotex> im sure there is a logical explanation
23:23 < Hjax> does anyone know if senseTreeAtLocation works for any part of the tree?
23:23 < Hjax> or does it have to be the center/
23:23 < tfk> its not a crazy mechanic
23:24 < kamiyama> I've only ever heard of upkeep for units
23:24 < tfk> just it seems like a mechnaic that needs to be in place at the start
23:24 < battlecode685> maybe they delivered the sandwiches to burton conner cuz i saw someone else ask for them to be delivered there....
23:24 < tfk> since it changes things a lot
23:24 < kamiyama> I think it's too much change for it to be implemented now
23:24 < kamiyama> like people would have to rewrite a huge amount of code
23:24 < Platinuman> even 1 bullet per turn is way too much
23:24 < battlecode685> but yea this bytecode change would be wack
23:25 < battlecode685> cuz all my code uses hella bytecodes
23:25 < tfk> it might not come with upkeep --- idk --- it might be like just you get 10k and if you want 20k you spend a bullet
23:25 < tfk> or something
23:25 < tfk> no clue
23:27 < kamiyama> ok i do see a branch called buy-bytecode

00:53 < CertifiedPyro> damn, auto matchmaking happens pretty often
00:54 < CertifiedPyro> that's great
00:54 < tfk> every 20 minutes or something
00:55 < battletoad255> auto matching?
00:55 < CertifiedPyro> a bit worried it'll clog up the queue a lot though
00:56 < tfk> eh it'll probably be fine
01:04 < u___> i'm a bit worried no really good teams will do it :P

02:14 < alkemyst> Has something changed over the last 24 hours? I've not touched the code for my Archon at all today, and it's now throughing an ExceptionInInitializerError
02:15 < CertifiedPyro> the only thing that changed was patch 1.4.0
02:15 < alkemyst> That's what I thought, and what I was running yesterday i'm fairly sure :\
02:16 < CertifiedPyro> is the stack trace giving any hints as to what's causing the error?
02:19 < alkemyst> Ah I see what i've done now. Turns out I did make a small change after all
02:23 < CertifiedPyro> I don't know if this is asking too much, but do any of you have ways to determine if an archon is cramped into a small box (such as the map "Chess")?

11:33 < tfk> yes
11:33 < tfk> its just a map resource
11:33 < tfk> big stockpile of free bullets in corner of map
11:33 < tfk> your opponent finds it

11:36 < tfk> and in a future year they can use it
11:36 < tfk> I mentioned it I think
11:36 < Hjax> it would be a cool mechanic
11:36 < tfk> I saw branch on git
11:36 < Hjax> but yeah, we wont be seeing it this year im sure
11:36 < tfk> it would be okay to test it this year, but not if they change the free bytecode limit
11:36 < tfk> from 10k to 2k
11:37 < tfk> (this is the first Im hearing of a 2k base limit)

11:58 < Hjax> zxqfl: you guys should turn on automatic match making :D
11:58 < Hjax> or are you hiding strategies?
11:58 < zxqfl> we haven't updated our code since the sprint
11:58 < zxqfl> working on some long term new stuff
11:58 < Hjax> ah
11:58 < zxqfl> we definitely will eventually though
11:58 < Hjax> making use of the extra memory?
11:59 < Hjax> my team has found a use for 7600 of the memory locations
11:59 < zxqfl> yep
11:59 < Hjax> 7400*
11:59 < zxqfl> where can i view the automated matchmaking rankings?
11:59 < Hjax> zxqfl: there isnt a rating list
11:59 < zxqfl> oh, they're unrated?
11:59 < Hjax> theres a hidden rating list used for the matchmaking
12:00 < zxqfl> hm interesting
12:00 < Hjax> since it trys to pair you vs teams of similar caliber
12:00 < zxqfl> but you have no way of knowing exactly where you are?
12:00 < Hjax> correct
12:00 < Hjax> think of it as an unranked scrim on random maps
12:00 < zxqfl> weird
12:00 < zxqfl> i hope they use it for seeding
12:00 < Hjax> delivered to your doorstep every 20 minutes

13:57 < compilescalafrie> I need some clarification on the rc.move method.  I know that if the destination is outside the robot's stride radius, destination is amended to be at the stride radius.  Does the robot move towards the destination UNTIL stopped by an obstacle, or does it ammend destination to maplocation on the circumference of the stride radius, check if that's occupied, and if it is throws an exception (the robot doesn't move a distance

15:11 < oak_disciple> i know, I'll do that for the seeding for sure, it's just that I haven't thought about it yet

15:11 < CertifiedPyro> yeah, definitely a good thing to catch before the tournament
15:11 < hjax> do we know when seeding is?
15:11 < CertifiedPyro> anybody know if meta is farming or rush (soldier, lumberjack, etc)?

15:18 < VeniVidiVici> soldier rushing was originally popular
15:18 < oak_disciple> i found that soldier rush is pretty strong in close maps, and actually don't know what can beat it
15:18 < VeniVidiVici> then it got displaced by how good scouts were
15:18 < VeniVidiVici> but with scouts gone now it's strong again
15:18 < oak_disciple> like, if you start gardener soldier soldier and just rush their archon there's not much they can do
15:18 < hjax> yeah my team is spending time trying to detect good soldier rush maps
15:18 < hjax> and trying to defend soldier rushes on the other maps
15:19 < VeniVidiVici> the problem with trying to detect if it's a good map for soldier rush

15:19 < oak_disciple> nah you can decide it at turn 0 i think
15:19 < hjax> VeniVidiVici, you just have to decide based on your initial vision
15:19 < oak_disciple> just by how many trees there are and the position of the enemy archon
15:19 < hjax> if you are point blank to an archon, you probably should soldier rush
15:19 < VeniVidiVici> ah ok
15:19 < VeniVidiVici> that's hard to decide though
15:19 < hjax> yeah
15:19 < hjax> but you have to try something
15:20 < VeniVidiVici> something like crossfire you still want to soldier rush for instance
15:20 < hjax> close quarters for instance
15:20 < oak_disciple> its better than building the same every game
15:20 < hjax> its impossible to defend a soldier rush on close quarters

15:55 < gang_gang_gang> btiberi also, do you know what happened to the subway sandwiches on friday?
15:55 < tfk> yaya battlecode should make more use of email announcements
15:55 < tfk> for things like this
15:55 < tfk> *checks email to see if one was sent 5 minutes ago*
15:55 < btiberi> It will be emailed out shortly
15:56 < hjax> i stay on irc, since im not a MIT student and dont watch the lectures
15:56 < btiberi> It's also on the forum: http://www.battlecodeforum.org/t/seeding-for-the-seeding-tournament/629
15:56 < hjax> so gossip is the best way to learn things
15:56 -!- gang_gang_gang is now known as kamiyama
15:56 < hjax> half the people on the forums cant even write their sentences coherently, so i dont read it
15:57 < kamiyama> yes, I also do not follow the forums
15:57 < battlecode424> yea good point, what happened to the sandwiches on friday?
15:57 < btiberi> I'm offsite, so no sandwiches for me :P
15:57 < kamiyama> where is dinosaurs?
15:58 < kamiyama> #sandwichgate
15:59 < battlecode424> they got deleted like hiliary clintons emails

16:00 < nmccoy-dev> The sandwiches arrived at like 8:40 and only 4 people were left
16:00 < battlecode642> oh no, did you guys throw them away?
16:00 < nmccoy-dev> Subway goofed and thought we were doing takeout and not delivery, so we had to uber and get them
16:00 < battlecode424> did they finish all the sandwiches?
16:00 < nmccoy-dev> They were distributed among living groups and got eaten eventually :)
16:00 < battlecode642> ++
16:01 < kamiyama> ++
16:01 < battlecode424> ++
16:01 < hjax> nmccoy-dev, also i just want to thank you (and the other devs) for running this whole thing, its so much fun
16:01 < tfk> missing sandviches should make all of us suspicious of establishment.
16:02 < kamiyama> the next battlecode should be sandwich themed

16:02 < kamiyama> don't worry I'll buy you some sandwiches
16:02 < nmccoy-dev> Aww sorry! If you make the final tournament we will fly you here and there will be pizza
16:03 < hjax> nmccoy-dev, i live within driving distance, and im trying my best make it to the top 16
16:04 < hjax> meeting all the other competitors sounds like so much fun
16:05 < oak_disciple> i'm in the same situation as hjax
16:06 < oak_disciple> will european students also get a free flight ticket?
16:06 < oak_disciple> (in case we get to the finals of course)
16:06 < hjax> oak_disciple, oh wow you are much further away than i am
16:06 < hjax> i go to school a bit over an hour from MIT
16:06 < hjax> i can just take a bus XD
16:07 < kamiyama> I'm unemployed
16:07 < oak_disciple> ah... I wish I could, lectures and tournaments must be a lot of fun live
16:07 < whaack> oak_disciple i'm sure you'll at least get a partially funded ticket if not a fully funded one, but I have no idea and I"m just guessing
16:07 < darthjarjar> oak_disciple you're felix and hte buggers right?
16:08 < oak_disciple> hahaha
16:08 < oak_disciple> only one of us is from that team

16:09 < darthjarjar> oak_disciple i'm eli from polar vortex
16:10 < darthjarjar> not sure about tamini haha
16:10 < darthjarjar> she goes to mit now

16:10 < hjax> yeah they got second XD
16:10 < oak_disciple> wow
16:10 < hjax> yeah, she was so active in irc last year, havent heard a word from her this year
16:10 < hjax> her bouncer keeps her connected to irc, but thats all
16:11 < oak_disciple> so how come you're last place in rankings, darthjarjar?
16:11 < battlecode642> kamiyama, that's unfortunate
16:11 < darthjarjar> probably just doing other stuff
16:11 < hjax> thats not him
16:11 < hjax> wrong jarjar
16:11 < darthjarjar> lol yeah
16:11 < battlecode642> hopefully u make top 16 so u get some money
16:11 < darthjarjar> we aren't last plac
16:11 < darthjarjar> but we also definitey aren't any close to top 2 atm

19:28 < oak_disciple> oooh that must be it
19:29 < oak_disciple> so victory points are integers and bullets are floats, I forgot
19:29 < CertifiedPyro> make sure you're donating more that rc.getVictoryPointCost()

19:52 < battlecode595> Damn I'm really sorry about that ;(
19:53 < kodomodo> jarjarbits: that's what it's there for. I pay taxes so people who need help get it.
19:53 < jarjarbits> i just need to figure out how to get started with health insurance or something like that so i can get to a point where i can work
19:54 < jarjarbits> it's a last resort, but i'd rather pull my own weight if at all possible

19:54 < battlecode844> hi, just a question, will the results of the automated matchmaking be entirely used to determine seedings?
19:55 < jarjarbits> the doctors want to do some stuff that they say will easily be over $100k/yr
19:55 < battlecode844> so, ranked doesn't matter?
19:55 -!- u___ [~u_@mobile-130-126-255-213.near.illinois.edu] has joined #battlecode
19:55 < CertifiedPyro> auto matchmaking is used for seeding tournament, and the result of that is used for qualifying tournament
19:55 < CertifiedPyro> so ranked doesn't matter
19:55 < battlecode844> thanks
19:56 < battlecode844> do I have to have it turned on at all times?
19:56 < jarjarbits> sorry for getting off topic, lol, back to battlecode :-)
19:56 < battlecode595> jarjarbits no worries, hope everything turns out ok
19:56 < CertifiedPyro> battlecode844 you don't need it turned on at all times, but you need at least 10 matches to get seeded into the seeding tournament
19:56 < Leucosia> ^^
19:57 -!- u____ [~u_@mobile-130-126-255-213.near.illinois.edu] has joined #battlecode
19:57 < battlecode844> seems like it wouldn't be very beneficial to have it turned on at all times
19:57 < CertifiedPyro> yeah, especially if you don't have a good bot, turn it off for now
19:57 < jarjarbits> thanks, i'm not too worried, i know how the big picture works out and where i go when i die, so all this stuff in the middle isn't really that difficult anymore
19:57 < battlecode844> it plays around every 15 minutes or so
19:57 < battlecode844> right
19:57 < CertifiedPyro> i think it's every 20 min
19:58 < tfk> would be nice to figure out if they are maintaining a prior strength
19:58 < battlecode844> is there any way to see the rankings for the auto matchmaking
19:58 < tfk> because if so, there's a disadvantage to keeping match making on if your scrimmage bot is out of date
19:59 < battlecode844> i feel like players should want some idea of "am i ahead or behind of everyone else"

20:02 < battlecode844> @CertifiedPyro thanks so much and they should really make you a dev you seem to be on top of everything
20:02 < jarjarbits> 34
20:03 < CertifiedPyro> I'm just supremely bored and want to avoid doing homework
20:03 < battlecode844> best of luck jarjarbits :(
20:04 < jarjarbits> lol, probably to old to be into battlecode but i have no official coding experience, so i figured it would be good to put on a resume... but that didn't quite play out
20:04 < Leucosia> hey now! some of us might be even older than 34 :)
20:04 < jarjarbits> :-)
20:04 < Leucosia> and learning scala
20:04 < battlecode595> that's impressive for someone that doesn't have an official coding background
20:04 < Leucosia> and using this as a fun way to get into it
20:05 < jarjarbits> never stop learning
20:05 < CertifiedPyro> wow! have we found a rare scala specimen?
20:05 < battlecode595> that's really impressive
20:05 < battlecode595> scala > better
20:05 < Leucosia> that would be me
20:05 < Hjax> thousands of many hours would be saved we didnt support scala
20:05 < Hjax> since build spends most of its time in compile scala
20:05 < Leucosia> we'll see how this goes - I keep getting tripped up
20:05 < jarjarbits> i've always goofed around with side projects, but this is definitely pushing me to learn more structured stuff
20:05 < Hjax> and like 4 people use it
20:06 < Hjax> man hours*
20:06 < CertifiedPyro> didn't only 2 people use it last year?
20:06 < Hjax> yes, and there was a prize for best scala team
20:06 < Leucosia> I know there is at least one other team this year since they reported a bug right before the sprint tournament
20:07 < Leucosia> other than that, not sure of anyone else

21:01 < legobridge> Hey how does seeding actually work
21:01 < legobridge> Didn't quite get how they seeded the sprint tournament bracket
21:03 < CertifiedPyro> the seeding tournament coming up is based on the auto matchmaking matches. People who have less than 10 auto matchmaking matches are ranked lower than those who have more than 10
21:03 < VeniVidiVici> for sprint it was based on scrimmage results
21:03 < VeniVidiVici> for upcoming seeding tournament it'll be by new automatchmaking scrimmage results
21:04 < VeniVidiVici> which i'm now sad about because we randomly went up to 4th
21:04 < kodomodo> @VeniVidiVici 4th in the new or old?

21:14 < legobridge> No I know all that, I just wanted to know how exactly they decide who fights who using scrimmage rankings
21:14 < legobridge> Basically what is seeding really
21:15 < battlecode595> maybe they just find the person closest to your rank and match you up with them
21:15 < VeniVidiVici> oh
21:15 < legobridge> Nah
21:15 < VeniVidiVici> first you get down to a power of 2
21:15 < VeniVidiVici> say 256
21:15 < VeniVidiVici> then 1 v 256, 2 v 255, etc.
21:16 < legobridge> So that the best meet last and the finals looks cool?
21:16 < VeniVidiVici> yes in theory
21:16 < legobridge> Can Scout radii intersect?
21:16 < legobridge> As in the circles of their 1 radius
21:18 < VeniVidiVici> i don't think so
21:18 < VeniVidiVici> units shouldn't be able to intersect

22:40 < Leucosia> do you have to run from the client? if not, try with run and then open the client and run the match file
22:40 < Robotex> i wanted to see the match
22:40 < Robotex> can you run the match offline then save and load/
22:40 < Robotex> ?
22:42 < Leucosia> haven't tried it myself, but I thought that is what would happen if I put this in the terminal: ./gradlew run -offline -PteamA=team012  -PteamB=team012test -Pmaps=Barrier

23:36 < Robotex_> great help
23:38 < battlecode371> Anyone getting a bug similar to mine? My dodge method compares the angle from the bullet to the center of the robot TO the angle between the center of the robot and the edge of the robot. If the angle from the center of the robot to the bullet is smaller, you know it will hit the robot.
23:39 < kodomodo> is that a bug?
23:39 < battlecode371> However, with the change to the soldier's stride radius, if you move once in the direction perpendicular to the bullets direction the bullet will still hit the robot
23:39 < battlecode371> But when you compare the angles, the angle between the robot and bullet ends up being bigger
23:40 < kodomodo> which edge are you checking?

23:40 < battlecode371> robot radius
23:41 < kodomodo> I mean which side of the robot
23:41 < kodomodo> oh nvm hold on
23:42 < battlecode371> Yeah I dont think it should matter
23:42 < battlecode371> the two angles im comparing are the bullet center to the robot center
23:42 < battlecode371> and the robots center to the edge of the robot
23:43 < battlecode371> if the angle from the bullet to robots center is smaller that means it will hit the robot
23:44 < kodomodo> ok from the robots center
23:45 < kodomodo> to the edge of the robot?
23:45 < kodomodo> or do you mean bullet center to edge?
23:45 < battlecode371> Former
23:46 < kodomodo> ok the edge of the robot is all around the center, so it could be any angle.

23:53 < kodomodo> ok hold on
23:53 < kodomodo> look at the imege
23:53 < Robotex_> i see
23:54 < Robotex_> i think what you need to calculate first is the radians the bullet needs to be in between
23:54 < Robotex_> to hit you
23:54 < Robotex_> then you check to see what the bullet radian actually is
23:55 < Robotex_> if the direction in radians is in between the left and thr right radian than you will get hit
23:55 < Robotex_> if you are outside both it will miss
23:55 < kodomodo> yah
23:56 < kodomodo> that's what I meant by which side are you checking
23:57 < Robotex_> you i would check direction from the bullet location
23:57 < battlecode371> I think I get what your saying? Im using the radiansbetween method in the direction class to calculate it
23:57 < battlecode371> So it takes into account the sign
23:57 < kodomodo> how about this
23:59 < Robotex_> you need to use radians
--- Day changed Tue Jan 24 2017
00:00 < Robotex_> and the angle will change based on distance
00:00 < Robotex_> the farter you go the more acute the angle that defines the hitbox will be
00:00 < Robotex_> the closer you are to the bullet the arger
00:02 < Robotex_> here is an idea
00:03 < Robotex_> you want to get the angle of the bullet to your edges correct?
00:03 < Robotex_> so get Direction to, your mid point. rotate right 90 degrees add your body radius for one edge
00:04 < Robotex_> and direction to your midpoint rotate left 90 degrees add your body radius for other edge
00:04 < Robotex_> if the bullet traveling direction is between those 2 angles
00:04 < Robotex_> it will hit

00:13 < Robotex_> ....
00:13 < Robotex_> :)
00:13 < Robotex_> here is a better problem
00:13 < Robotex_> how can you tell if a friendly robot is in your cone of fire
00:14 < kodomodo> well it's easy for single shots
00:14 < Robotex_> regardless of type of shot you are taking
00:18 < kodomodo> um
00:19 < Leucosia> ^^
00:20 < kodomodo> senseRObots in circle ahead of you
00:20 < kodomodo> maybe 3 times, increasing distance and radius
00:22 < Robotex_> thats a neat approach
00:22 < Robotex_> i had not thought of it
00:22 < Robotex_> the only issue is i guess with single shots
00:22 < kodomodo> oh
00:23 < kodomodo> then you do like 1 check of radius 0.02 every .5 units or something
00:23 < Robotex_> but a good idea.. can sense ahead and iterate through the result for if in or out of cone of fire

00:27 < Robotex_> i would only use it once
00:27 < battlecode371> So the situation is basically. If you shoot at a robot and that robot moves directly perpendicular to the bullet the bullet will still end up hitting it
00:27 < battlecode371> For soldiers atleast
00:27 < battlecode371> Correct?

01:28 < battlecode178> Hey
01:28 < cbrenci> can a gardener only water once per turn?
01:28 < battlecode178> How do you guys do pathing?
01:28 < battlecode178> Yes only once
01:28 < necaremus_> wtf, how? i tried something... and first try... it worked O_o
01:29 < whaack> can a lumberjack shake, chop, and strike all in one turn?
01:29 < CertifiedPyro> 0_0
01:29 < CertifiedPyro> a lumberjack can either chop or strike, but not both
01:29 < CertifiedPyro> lumberjack can shake once, regardless if either of those happen
01:38 < VeniVidiVici> my program is like

01:40 < gongy> errr
01:40 < CertifiedPyro> hmm...ok. I'm at 1k lines right now, but the program's still growing, it's getting hard to keep track of all the global variables and broadcasts now

01:42 < CertifiedPyro> woops
01:42 < CertifiedPyro> i accidentally pasted 60 lines
01:45 < cbrenci> so i'm hitting some weird issues, could use some clarification
01:46 < CertifiedPyro> anybody know if senseTreeAtLocation(MapLocation loc) requires the center of the tree, or just any part of the tree?
01:46 < cbrenci> if i want to water a tree, any part of that tree needs to be within interactiondistance of any part of my robot?
01:47 < CertifiedPyro> i think it might be center? not sure
01:47 < VeniVidiVici> just any part
01:49 < CertifiedPyro> oh really?
01:49 < VeniVidiVici> but they're ordered by center
01:49 < VeniVidiVici> i think that's what dev said ealrier

06:02 < gongy> is there a way to duplicate without having to change every single package thing
06:06 < oak_disciple> yeah
06:06 < oak_disciple> right click the package, copy
06:06 < oak_disciple> rightclick the src folder, paste
06:11 < gongy> oak_disciple, huh?
06:11 < gongy> i mean you have to go into each file and change the package name right?
06:11 < oak_disciple> no you don't, at least in intellij
06:12 < gongy> does intellij auto change the package name?
06:12 < oak_disciple> yes, to the name you tell it to
06:12 < globalpointer> when I do that ^ it copies the folder into the other folder...
06:12 < oak_disciple> really? it worked for me :/
06:12 < globalpointer> like copying A to B, it just makes a copy of A in B

13:26 < Hjax> what team are you?
13:26 < neeca> teamSheep (we have nothing gud, yet)
13:26 < neeca> and i do like ~2% of the work :3
13:27 < Hjax> you guys should upload and start playing auto mm matches

13:36 < battlecode586> woops
13:37 < battlecode586> is the seeding round a "gate", in that if your team doesn't make it through seeding with the submitted RobotPlayer they don't go to qualifying.  Or is the seeding just a placement round and everyone who is in the seeding round will be in the qualifier?
13:39 < Hjax> battlecode586, i /think/ the latter

13:41 < battlecode586> ok, that's good.  I'm not an MIT student, just a team of four brothers learning to code and thought this looked like fun and we'd see how we'd fare against the brainiacs.  You can imagine we are in the sprint phase of this right now and are pretty f'd if the seeding deadline is gate with what we will have by tomorrow night
13:42 < Hjax> battlecode586, im not an MIT student either :P

13:43 < battlecode586> we've literally learned java while doing this via google university.  My only experience is C# so it wasn't too hard of a transition for me, but the other members of my team are pretty much figuring it out as they go.

13:45 < Hjax_> Yeah everyone can play in qual/main

13:47 < battlecode543> oh they fly you in, but not back? haha

14:38 < oak_disciple> what's the point of the soldier nerf?
14:38 < tfk> idk
14:38 < CertifiedPyro> Oh, i believe it's due to dodging
14:38 < tfk> imho these nerfs to stride radius are a little misguided

14:38 < tfk> real nerfs would increase body radius
14:39 -!- battlecode049 is now known as kamiyama
14:39 < CertifiedPyro> since the stride radius was a multiple of the body radius, dodging a bullet sometimes depended on floating point
14:39 < oak_disciple> but it's a really small nerf, I mean, they must have something in mind with that nerf
14:39 < tfk> yea 0.95 is probably just for fp errors
14:39 < tfk> but I doubt it entirely resolves issue
14:39 <@kazimuth> Yeah, that's why
14:39 < oak_disciple> ah, that makes sense
14:39 <@kazimuth> it's slight silly
14:40 <@kazimuth> but it does resolve a good amount of ambiguity, and it's hard to work around that issue otherwise
14:43 < oak_disciple> but to be honest I never noticed that issue with the floating point locations, is it common?
14:44 <@kazimuth> It's somewhat difficult to notice
14:44 <@kazimuth> basically if a bullet is aimed at the center of a soldier and the soldier dodges one stride, it's ambiguous whether it's hit or not
14:44 <@kazimuth> and we strive to resolve ambiguity

14:56 < reason> Hello, when I am planting a tree, is there a way to get the ID of the tree? Because I want to water it later on and I cannot get the tree's location
14:57 < reason> How can I get the exact location from a tree, I just planted when I know my location and the direction I am planting?
14:58 < CertifiedPyro> if you have the direction you planted it in, you can take myLoc.add(dir, rc.getType().bodyRadius + GameConstants.GENERAL_SPAWN_OFFSET + GameConstants.BULLET_TREE_RADIUS)

15:55 < oak_disciple> yeah, I think that our record vs him in single games is 3 to 20, so good job on beating him!

15:56 <@kazimuth> isn't it?
15:56 < tfk> I believe w.r.t. the convention
15:56 < tfk> but it would make more sense the other way around
15:56 < tfk> "match" match-up between two players
15:56 < Hjax> yeah i think a match consisting of multiple games makes more sense
15:56 < tfk> consisting of multiple instances of a game
15:56 < tfk> :)
15:56 < Hjax> ^ i agree with tfk
15:56 < oak_disciple> you can also say Bo1 and Bo3, it's more clear this way
15:56 < tfk> yea much more clear
15:56 < tfk> :/
15:56 < tfk> haha
15:57 <@kazimuth> definitely
15:57 < tfk> I'll just say thingymajig
15:57 <@kazimuth> fair
15:57 <@kazimuth> fun fact, it's actually because when I wrote the game-saving code I screwed up the order and only noticed a month later
15:58 < oak_disciple> but honestly watching our replays vs bruteforcer, it seems that he has a million build orders hard coded, or he decides what to build dynamically... We just use one single build for every match
15:58 < battlecode543> heya bruteforcer here
15:58 < battlecode543> just saw the game on arena! nice work
15:59 < battlecode543> my build orders are dynamic
15:59 < battlecode543> which is why barrier tends to be my worst map, information at the start there doesnt suggest its a map youll end up stuck on
16:00 < Hjax> battlecode543 oooh you are on irc!

16:02 < oak_disciple> oh man i'm excited already
16:02 < Hjax> siestaguru, i have to know, are you a student? a professional? whats your background?
16:03 < siestaguru> was a general software engineering student a few years ago, working in unrelated company right now
16:03 < siestaguru> did a small ai section in it though
16:03 < Yewlo> how much time have you spent on this?
16:03 < siestaguru> and have worked a little on a similar competition in the past (robocode)
16:04 < siestaguru> hmm, about 70-80ish hours I think
16:04 < siestaguru> its quite a lot of work getting this right
16:04 < Hjax> ooh robocode is fun, i never really played it much, i played a programming game called robotgame for a while
16:05 < siestaguru> is that still running?
16:05 < Hjax> https://robotgame.net/
16:05 < Hjax> it exists, its community is pretty dead
16:05 < Hjax> i was rank one at it for a while
16:05 < siestaguru> ah cool
16:05 < siestaguru> was nothing special here at robocode :P
16:06 < siestaguru> working a bit on an AI mod for civ 6 from time to time too
16:06 < siestaguru> thought id take a break and do this
16:06 < Hjax> siestaguru, yeah i saw the ai mod when i googled your name
16:06 < Hjax> i was trying to figure out who this mysterious figure who was cleaning house at sprint was

16:08 < Hjax> siestaguru, my bot seems to naively expect to not be attacked on large maps

16:08 < siestaguru> ha
16:08 -!- mode/#battlecode [+o kazimuth] by ChanServ
16:08 < oak_disciple> the thing with large maps is that you can't know if there's a big path for the enemy to come and kill you, you just have to risk it
16:09 < siestaguru> Im betting it pays off often enough
16:09 < oak_disciple> in my case I like big maps because our late game is good, so if we survive the beginning chances are we'll win
16:09 < siestaguru> its pretty common for one of my attacks to go off, but they cant find the gardener and get stuck on one of the archons

16:10 < siestaguru> im a little scared about the lack of team waterloo/rocket on the scrims
16:10 < siestaguru> wonder what theyre up to
16:11 < zxqfl> we'll turn it on sometime tonight
16:11 < tfk> I saw waterloo
16:11 < tfk> yesterday
16:11 < zxqfl> don't expect much, we don't even build tanks yet
16:12 < siestaguru> well, theyre not guaranteed winners anyway
16:12 < siestaguru> wish they buffed lumberjacks up a little again
16:13 < siestaguru> or what do you think hjax? you guys have been using tanks a lot it seems
16:14 < Hjax> we think tanks are overpowered
16:14 < oak_disciple> yeah, same here
16:15 < siestaguru> hmm
16:15 < Hjax> 1 tank beats like 4 soldiers or literally infinite lumberjacks
16:15 < siestaguru> feels theyre worth their cost to me, but often just die without doing anything / get stuck somewhere
16:15 < Hjax> that only happens if you are building them too early
16:15 < Hjax> eventually your eco is large enough that you can just bulldoze the map
16:16 < Hjax> like late game my team will just have like 50 tanks
16:16 < Hjax> they dont really care if theres stuff in their way
16:16 < siestaguru> with that big of an eco you oculd probably just victory points for the win
16:16 < Hjax> yeah probably, but map domination is more consistent imo
16:17 < oak_disciple> we still have to make tanks kill trees though... We're having a hard time figuring out how to make them decide between going straight through the trees or just walking around them

16:17 < Hjax> im pretty sure my tanks just always bulldoze trees
16:17 < siestaguru> poor lumberjacks though.. they get decimated by soldiers too, cant touch scouts
16:17 < siestaguru> why do they have to move slower than soldiers? :/
16:17 < Hjax> yeah lumberjacks are pretty lackluster combat units
16:17 < Hjax> i wouldnt be opposed to buffing them
16:18 < tfk> I have a hard time telling if my lumberjacks are attacking
16:18 < tfk> or just moving around randomly
16:18 < tfk> in a state of stupor
16:18 < siestaguru> hha
16:18 < Hjax> just set an indicator dot when they attack
16:18 < tfk> should buff lumberjack theatrics
16:18 < siestaguru> mine get so busy dodging bullets theyll never reach the soldiers
16:18 < tfk> give them some glowing attack orbs
16:18 < oak_disciple> The thing is that lumberjacks aren't a combat unit, but more of a unit that goes around the map looking for trees with stuff and enemy trees
16:18 < tfk> ya I'm fine with lumberjacks being useless in combat
16:19 < siestaguru> during the scrim they were reasonable combat units, not as strong as soldiers, but they could manage
16:19 < siestaguru> that felt nicer
16:20 < tfk> I think they're in a reasonable place now... don't really care too much
16:20 < siestaguru> now you often just lose if you start out with soldier + lumber instead of double soldier on tiny maps :(

16:20 < siestaguru> yeah thats true
16:20 < tfk> I mean if a team hardcodes
16:21 < tfk> errr doesn't code any lumberjack logic
16:21 < tfk> they'll not go very far

16:21 < siestaguru> chop trees with penta shots, works great!
16:21 < tfk> haha
16:21 < tfk> calculate cost of lumberjack
16:21 < tfk> vs cost of shooting the tree
16:22 < siestaguru> I guess theres a reason real lumberjacks dont just open fire
16:22 < tfk> should make archons able to cast spells
16:22 < tfk> to turn enemy units into trees
16:22 < tfk> for like 100 rounds
16:22 < tfk> ;)
16:23 < siestaguru> something for archons wouldve been nice
16:23 < oak_disciple> I'd like for archons to be useful, they just feel like an annoying unit that blocks your path haha
16:23 < VeniVidiVici> just disintegrate them (y)
16:23 < oak_disciple> they don't have much to decide yet they have the most bytecode available

16:23 < siestaguru> just insta kill their archon every round
16:23 < siestaguru> mightve been an exception though
16:23 < tfk> doesn't seem too wise
16:24 < tfk> but maybe an okay "omg we're at round 1000 and haven't done anything but build one gardener" strat
16:24 < siestaguru> they deleted their archon, build 5 trees, then spammed tanks out
16:24 < VeniVidiVici> that was intentional
16:24 < oak_disciple> while (true) { rc.resign(); }

16:28 < tfk> haha
16:28 < tfk> yea that map is kinda dumb
16:28 < VeniVidiVici> that too lol
16:28 < siestaguru> mine happens to be good at that, but felt so awful winning that
16:29 < VeniVidiVici> ours collapses on it
16:29 < VeniVidiVici> because if we have a gigantic army we assumed that game is basically over we just can't find last enemy for some reason
16:29 < VeniVidiVici> so we donate all our bullets :(
16:29 < VeniVidiVici> and lose to one tank
16:30 < oak_disciple> I just hope that when I get eliminated it's not because their scout reached the 1000 bullet tree 1 turn before mine
16:30 < siestaguru> theres this common bug there where two untis get stuck on top of each other
16:30 < siestaguru> wonder what they can do about that
16:30 < siestaguru> when a scout is above a tree that gets cut down with a unit inside

16:36 < siestaguru> well...
16:36 < VeniVidiVici> or at least you can react to them
16:36 < siestaguru> what do you do when the enemy is at 700 points
16:36 < VeniVidiVici> cry
16:36 < siestaguru> and theres trees in the way
16:37 < VeniVidiVici> but at least you can build some scouts earlier if you think it's a turtle or something
16:37 < siestaguru> true
16:37 < siestaguru> but they probably wont actually get any points until like turn 500
16:37 < VeniVidiVici> really
16:37 < VeniVidiVici> i thought most turtles were exchanging early to take adv of rate
16:37 < siestaguru> I think most would begin with exponential growth through just spamming gardeners
16:38 < VeniVidiVici> yeah maybe
16:38 < VeniVidiVici> will have to think about this

17:26 < Centroyed> Hi all! I'm still new to all of this so forgive my noobness (and I'm a bit late too...) My scout/soldier keeps getting in the way of his own bullets :( This kills him quite quickly. I'm sorry if this is a really basic question, but I'm kinda stuck... Should I try and make a more complex attacking code snippet where the scout constantly circles around its target? Thanks!
17:27 < oak_disciple> you can try shooting after you move
17:27 < VeniVidiVici> yeah simplest way is to always do the movement before the shooting
17:28 < VeniVidiVici> used to be that scouts could still run into their own bullets but that's no longer a thing

17:31 < gabrielsimoes> any clues?
17:31 < Centroyed> okay, got it thanks guys!
17:31 < VeniVidiVici> @gabriel: probably so they can't dodge bullets that would hit them next turn by luck
17:31 < VeniVidiVici> used to be if you moved perpendicularly you'd dodge depending on floating point rounding
17:31 < VeniVidiVici> which is not great

18:23 < tfk> wait no you meant regular price
18:23 < tfk> on-demand usually doesn't change much
18:23 < tfk> surprised you can fit 4 on m4.large
18:23 < tfk> lol
18:23 < Guest93158> oh wow that's not too bad
18:23 <@bovard> yeah, It's already gone from 8 runners to 4
18:23 <@bovard> I won't be surprised when it goes to 2 :D
18:23 < tfk> I usually do one match per physical cpu

18:24 < thereg> at which times are the current auto-rankings published?
18:24 < tfk> wait is bovard a dev
18:24 < tfk> if so you are paying way too much...
18:24 < tfk> I get a c4.4xlarge for that price
18:24 < tfk> using spot instances
18:24 < Guest93158> what is a spot instance?
18:24 < tfk> you pay market price
18:24 < tfk> its usually between 2-4x less expensive than on-demand
18:25 < tfk> you just have to tolerate your instance being turned off
18:25 < tfk> which... for something like running matches isn't a problem
18:25 <@bovard> I suppose we could move things over to on-demand, but we don't have the best recovery story when matches go away (match is stuck in "running" for an hour)
18:25 < thereg> tfk: the question is if you care if you got the budget ;)
18:25 < tfk> yes
18:25 <@bovard> Yes I'm a dev
18:25 < tfk> of course you care
18:25 < Guest93158> how long does it get turned off? is it like heroku or something

18:26 < tfk> no one has infinite money
18:26 < tfk> can increase # of machines in queue to increase throughput/decrease latency while keeping costs fixed --- at least
18:26 < tfk> anyways, devs should look at auto scaling groups using spot instances for workers next year

18:27 < tfk> handling instances that turn off is super easy
18:28 < Guest93158> how long does it get turned off for though? and does it clear the ram when it gets turned off?
18:28 <@bovard> I'm assuming they send your running processes a kill signal of some kind?
18:28 < tfk> it just gets killed
18:28 < tfk> you get a few minutes warning
18:28 < tfk> but you don't really need to worry about it
18:28 < tfk> it runs shutdown command which blocks incoming connections
18:28 < tfk> for a few minutes
18:29 < tfk> a hacky way to do things is just check if you can establish connection before running match, and then check again afterwards
18:29 < tfk> and rerun if either checks fail
18:29 <@bovard> we're using a pull system
18:29 <@bovard> so if we know we're doomed, we can stop pulling
18:29 <@bovard> unless we're running a 20 min match or something
18:29 < tfk> ah yea that's easier then
18:29 < tfk> for us we have some more complexities
18:29 < tfk> because we run two player bots on different machines
18:30 < tfk> (because performance interference could impact match)
18:30 < tfk> so you'd just want to periodically check to see if you can establish connection
18:31 < tfk> oh nvm, you meant workers pull to get matches to run
18:31 <@bovard> Did you look at how well docker does for evenly distributing compute/memory? We're running on ECS and you specify how much CPU/Ram each container gets
18:31 < tfk> docker isn't a good fit for 6.172 because we need very reliable performance

18:31 < tfk> since performance variation would cause players to play differently
18:32 < tfk> for pull system, I guess you need to have machines give status updates
18:32 < tfk> paradoxically, I think the pull system which is usually simpler design wise, is more annoying for handling failures

18:33 <@bovard> currently we put matches that are ready to be played on SQS "enqueued" status
18:33 < tfk> can't really rely on timeouts in-general because battlecode matches have historically varied tremendously
18:33 < gabrielsimoes> lol, i hate java passing things by value
18:33 < tfk> yaya
18:33 < gabrielsimoes> ruining my bytecode limit
18:33 < tfk> issue is once someone claims that item
18:33 <@bovard> when runners lease the task, they lease for 1 hr
18:33 <@bovard> Wish we could do less, but we've had some 35 min matches
18:33 < tfk> oh, well if you are okay with handling 1 hour delays
18:33 < tfk> that's fine
18:34 < tfk> neways. $0.1 per hour for an m4 large is very bad
18:34 <@bovard> yeah it's fine when it only happens very occasionally
18:34 < tfk> When we used c4.large instances we were paying around 1-2 cents
18:34 < tfk> per hour
18:34 <@bovard> but with spot instances it would be more of a problem

18:48 < whaack> listed?
18:48 < whaack> for each unit?
18:48 < siestaguru> gettype().bulletcost

18:50 < tfk> single shots are sometimes good
18:50 < gabrielsimoes> I think bullet cost varies
18:50 < gabrielsimoes> I think tank bullet cost is greater
18:50 < aishair> siestaguru your bot is godlike
18:50 < gabrielsimoes> dunno actually
18:50 < siestaguru> im using it on tanks sometimes
18:50 < tfk> huh?
18:50 < aishair> you should know more than us :P
18:51 < siestaguru> :P
18:51 < CertifiedPyro> i use single shots if i want to kill a unit and there's a tree in the way
18:51 < tfk> I always discover like random important stuff in battlecode
18:51 < tfk> late
18:51 < tfk> lol
18:51 < aishair> yeah i use single also if there are teammates

18:51 < tfk> I have learned to periodically read java docs
18:51 < tfk> just in case I missed something
18:51 < gabrielsimoes> sorry, I think I was wrong
18:51 < siestaguru> I have a few rare usages, but its like 95% pentas/triads
18:51 < aishair> i was just watching a match where you beat me
18:51 < gabrielsimoes> just checked the specs, doesn't say anything about cost varying between robot types
18:52 < siestaguru> wondering if theres a more general usage
18:52 < aishair> and you beat me because i used some singles
18:52 < tfk> me?
18:52 < aishair> when i shoulda used triad/penta
18:52 < tfk> or someone else
18:52 < aishair> siestaguru
18:52 < tfk> ah
18:52 < siestaguru> which one was that?
18:52 < aishair> im zay
18:52 < aishair> my soldier micro was matching yours then i started shooting singles for some reason and got dominated
18:52 < siestaguru> yeah which game do you mean?
18:52 < aishair> oh man i forgot i played you so many times today
18:52 < siestaguru> your bot is getting quite scary these days now btw :) good job whatever you did
18:53 < aishair> :P thanks.
18:53 < aishair> found a few hours to work on it yesterday..
18:53 < tfk> have you heard of reddit, aishair?
18:53 < tfk> ;)
18:53 < tfk> its a fun site, you should check it out
18:53 < aishair> oh no
18:53 < aishair> don't do this to me
18:53 < tfk> :p
18:53 < aishair> this is another free day i have
18:54 < tfk> also, there's a great tv series on netflix called breaking bad
18:54 < tfk> and this cat called Maru
18:54 < tfk> :)
18:54 < aishair> hahah reelax!
18:54 < aishair> what team are you tfk?
18:54 < tfk> tetris
18:54 < siestaguru> which team were you from again tfk?
18:54 < siestaguru> ah
18:55 < tfk> I was automatching yesterday
18:55 < tfk> but turned it off since I have a lot of pending changes...
18:55 < siestaguru> shouldve turned mine off when i was still above arbitrary, my seed spot!
18:56 < VeniVidiVici> rocket/waterloo better turn it on soon
18:56 < siestaguru> oh wait
18:56 < VeniVidiVici> or this bracket is going to be destroyed lol
18:56 < tfk> waterloo was on yesterday
18:56 < siestaguru> yay, i got it back
18:56 < tfk> they probably turned it off for same reason as me, outdated bot
18:56 < VeniVidiVici> oh never mind they've played some
18:56 < tfk> or maybe its still on
18:56 < VeniVidiVici> lol the bot we have up is the same as sprint bot
18:56 < aishair> i think rocket and waterloo turned it on now
18:56 < VeniVidiVici> except it builds soldiers instead of scouts
18:56 < aishair> i shoulda turned mine off when i reached 1910 :(
18:57 < VeniVidiVici> hopefully stuff we've been working on this week helps D:
18:57 < siestaguru> yeah rocket is climbing fast
18:57 < tfk> well if elo system has similarly low-inertia (like scrimmage rankings), running 10 games after submission deadline probably will settle everyone into right spot
18:58 < tfk> so probably intermediate rankings don't matter that much
18:58 < tfk> its nice to not have to worry as much about the seeding game :)
18:59 < aishair> yeah this auto matchmaking thing is nice
18:59 < siestaguru> true that
18:59 < tfk> it takes away control, but it's much less stressful
18:59 < tfk> you used to have to be strategic about accepting scrimmages
18:59 < tfk> to ensure your rank was high enough so that close to deadlines highly seeded teams would be willing to scrimmage you
18:59 < tfk> lol
19:00 < siestaguru> I noticed none of the high seeded teams would still scrim me on ranked near the end
19:00 < tfk> yea its not worth the risk
19:00 < tfk> especially when accepting matches
19:00 < tfk> because you never know if someone is meta-gaming on a particular map set

19:01 < bigguy4u> Is there going to be a lecture today?
19:01 < aishair> ^yes i think it said so on the calendar
19:01 < globalpointer> ~_~ 1.5.0 is released pretty near to the tournament
19:01 < tfk> very minor changes though
19:01 < aishair> its good changes.
19:01 < globalpointer> ... depends on your bot I guess
19:02 < aishair> eh its globally good
19:02 < aishair> just makes less errors
19:02 < aishair> :P
19:02 < tfk> idk my dodging code has gotten simpler
19:02 < tfk> so this change doesn't impact me much
19:02 < tfk> other folks might be annoyed
19:02 < CertifiedPyro> tfw you have to choose between working on battlecode or homework

19:03 < aishair> ^ my life
19:04 < tfk> homework is lame
19:04 < whaack> are they still doing a dinner with the sponsors for the people who qualify?
19:05 < tfk> yea
19:05 < Guest93158> everyone has so many matches
19:05 < CertifiedPyro> god i'm so low on auto matchmaking ranks :/
19:05 < CertifiedPyro> i accidentally left it on while i had my old bot, so i lost most of them
19:05 < tfk> yea, be sure to give yourself a day or so
19:05 < tfk> to recover
19:06 < tfk> actually this is a good test

20:16 < jarjarbits> sorry, i was googling around but found nothing useful, thanks
20:17 < Hjax> kazimuth, so it appears teams are turning off ranked matchmaking once theyve played more than 10 games and have a record they like
20:17 < Hjax> kind of obnoxious imo
20:17 <@kazimuth> ...should have seen that coming

20:30 < Hjax> kazimuth, so are you guys going to try to turn on forced auto matchmaking scrims? or do you have something else in mind?
20:30 <@kazimuth> kodomodo: s/o/do
20:31 < kodomodo> clever
20:31 <@kazimuth> Hjax: That was the original intention but we're not sure if we actually want to do it or not
20:31 <@kazimuth> it's a fairly large change
20:31 < CertifiedPyro> what does s/o/do mean?
20:31 <@kazimuth> "replace o with do"
20:32 < VeniVidiVici> sounds like infinite loop :P
20:32 <@kazimuth> it's a fairly old IRC idiom :P
20:32 < kodomodo> @kazimuth I take that back. you tried very hard
20:33 <@kazimuth> i generally err on the side of trying too hard
20:35 -!- bovard [~bovard@c-71-63-231-164.hsd1.or.comcast.net] has joined #battlecode
20:36 < tfk> why not just enable auto matchmaking after submission deadline?
20:36 < tfk> to let things settle
20:37 < Hjax> also teams keep sending out unranked scrims to every single team, and then they fill they queue for an hour and theres no more auto mm games
20:40 < kodomodo> I second tfk's idea @kazimuth
20:40 <@kazimuth> I think it's a good idea
20:40 <@kazimuth> Seeing how the team feals
20:42 < VeniVidiVici> how about you just give us first seed
20:42 < VeniVidiVici> that would solve all these issues
20:43 < tfk> when everyone is top seed, no one is top seed
20:43 < tfk> :'(
20:43 < u___> Hjax: LOL wtf
20:43 < u___> how can you tell?
20:43 < u___> oh
20:43 < u___> well hm
20:43 < Hjax> because i get an unranked scrim
20:43 <@kazimuth> we may need to up our capacity -.-
20:43 < Hjax> and suddenly the queue has 120 matches in it
20:43 < u___> hah
20:43 < Hjax> and then i get not auto mm matches for an hour
20:43 < u___> yeah i like the auto scrims cause they prevent people from hiding strats
20:43 < u___> BUT
20:44 < u___> why have a seeding tourney then
20:44 < u___> actually tbh that seems to be the main problem
20:44 < tfk> @kazimuth, are you running using instances you launched from ami, or are you using an amazon meta service?
20:44 < tfk> (like lambda)
20:44 < u___> kazimuth: u prolly dont want to make it too clear whose bot is the best, or else qualifying/final tournies become kind of boring
20:44 <@kazimuth> yeahh, the structure is a bit odd
20:44 <@kazimuth> tfk: We're running on ECS, it's quite easy to scale
20:44 < u___> kazimuth: like if i've already done 2 or 2 auto games against all the top 16 im not gonna be hyped for one more
20:44 < Hjax> i would not be opposed to a higher game rate from auto MM
20:45 < tfk> was mainly wondering about pricing
20:45 < tfk> not ease of scaling
20:45 < Hjax> u___, the interesting thing about the tournies is there are new maps
20:45 <@kazimuth> I'm not actually sure about pricing
20:45 < u___> Hjax: true, but after sprint + seeding map sets it's more than enough to see who is better
20:45 < u___> this actually concerns me
20:45 <@kazimuth> It's not too important though, we have enough budget to cover servers as long as we're not, like, mining bitcoin
20:46 < tfk> ah kk
20:46 < u___> like i feel way less motivated to go to finals now (supposing i make it this year) if i already have a fairly clear picture of the rank
20:46 < tfk> idk, I don't think it'll be much different from the scrimmage rank
20:47 < tfk> in terms of predictive power
20:47 < aishair> just dont do any more auto matchmaking after the seeding tourney :P

20:48 < u___> with his crazy scouts

20:49 < tfk> idk
20:49 < tfk> I generally had a good idea of who would be 1st and 2nd
20:49 < tfk> every year
20:49 < u___> yeah we all knew duck would win
20:49 < u___> :P
20:49 < u___> but yeah maybe being able to hide good strats / hide how strong your bot is in general makes it more fun
20:49 < tfk> idk I think its annoying
20:50 < tfk> it forces you to pay attention to meta-gaming scrimmage rank
20:50 < aishair> its also annoying having no unpredictability
20:50 < tfk> which is distracting
20:50 < Hjax> i like being able to iterate vs strong bots
20:50 < Hjax> like, bruteforcer is the strongest atm
20:50 < Hjax> but hes in the publics eye
20:50 < Hjax> so people are working to beat him
20:50 < jbloxham_> well, at least once the seeding tournament is done, yall can save your strats until the final submission deadline if you want
20:51 < u___> yeah i guess
20:52 < bovard> Doesn't OPTIONAL auto-matchmaking solve for both of these concerns?
20:53 < aishair> ^ agreed
20:53 < bovard> It's VERY easy to hide starts after qualifying, since there is nothing to be gained from participating in auto-matchmaking anymore.
20:53 < aishair> aside from seeing others' bots
20:53 < bovard> If people are really worried about it, we could hide auto-matchmaking ranks after seeding as well, to increase the uncertainty
20:54 < aishair> you should definitely do that!
20:54 < u___> wait u mean after seeding
20:54 < Hjax> bovard the complaint i have about optional matchmaking atm is teams disabling it after they have a record they like
20:54 < VeniVidiVici> i mean
20:54 < VeniVidiVici> i don't understand the complaint
20:55 < VeniVidiVici> almost all tournaments have favorites/underdogs
20:55 < bovard> Hjax that existed under the old system as well (ranked scrimmage) right?
20:55 < u___> and yeah having it be mandatory for seeding tourney but not using it afterwards seems like a good balance
20:55 -!- gabrielsimoes [~gabrielsi@191.255.49.214] has quit [Quit: WeeChat 1.6]
20:55 < VeniVidiVici> but they're still interesting regardless
20:55 < Hjax> bovard, yes, but it was a complaint i had about the old system too :-)
20:55 < VeniVidiVici> e.g. a lot of the sprint tournament was quite unexpected
20:56 < bovard> Hjax additionally the average rankings tend to inflate as more teams start playing, so not playing could be a mistake
20:56 < bovard> We can discuss including everyone in the match-making rounds that will be played after the deadline though
20:57 < bovard> Hjax Maybe next year we'll increase the game number requirement or something that could help more
20:57 < kodomodo> it seems like a good idea to run the automatchmaking after deadline in secret, just for final seeding
20:57 < aishair> i also like the fact that the auto matchmaking was opened only shortly before the tournament
20:58 < aishair> maybe should do it like that always.
20:58 < u___> how about, give people the option to make their auto matches hidden
20:58 < Hjax> bovard, having an auto match making deadline before the code deadline might be cool
20:58 < Hjax> 2 days before seeding everyones auto mm gets turned on
20:58 < u___> so that neither party can see the result, it just perturbs the score and thats it

20:58 < VeniVidiVici> ^

20:59 < u___> Hjax: the point would be only sneaky people with sneaky strats would use it
20:59 < VeniVidiVici> there's barely any functional difference between +-5 seeds
20:59 < bovard> u___ I'd initially considered that too, it's certainly interesting to think about

20:59 < u___> because i think that sneaky surprise strategies are a lot of fun
20:59 < bovard> ^ agreed
20:59 < u___> like, Foundation was the life of the party because he was so unexpected
20:59 < bovard> but he got his Seeding rank with a regular bot
21:00 < bovard> then stopped playing matches until Qualiying
21:00 < u___> lol really
21:00 < u___> nice
21:00 < u___> knew what he was doing prolly
21:00 < bovard> yeah... no one saw that bot coming
21:00 < bovard> several team (including ours) had looked at doing that and shelved it as being too risky
21:00 < u___> so yeah Hjax what i mean is, if you enable the option, neither you nor your opponents can see the auto matches, it just serves to determine rankings
21:00 < u___> Hjax: i imagine not too many people would have it enabled at any given time
21:00 < aishair> which team was that? the suiciding one?
21:01 < bovard> the one that built only scouts
21:01 < aishair> ohhh that
21:01 < Hjax> aishair, the team that used scouts as zombie bait
21:01 < aishair> yeah that was cool lol
21:01 < u___> w8 bovard are you a dev this year
21:02 < bovard> indeed
21:02 < u___> ah
21:02 < u___> was confused cause ur name isn't in Team #0

21:02 < Hjax> bovard ooh i just found your website, you played planet wars

21:03 < bovard> That was so epic
21:03 < u___> rip google ai challenge
21:03 < aishair> what's planet wars?
21:03 < Hjax> an old ai challenge game like battlecode
21:03 < bovard> I thought halite would be as fun, since it's basically the same game, but turns out it's super lame.
21:03 < Hjax> run by waterloo
21:03 < aishair> oh is it still around Hjax?
21:03 < Hjax> aishair, no it died like 5-6 years ago
21:03 < Hjax> ants was the last one they ran
21:03 < aishair> aw okay
21:04 < bovard> It only ran once for 4 or so months
21:04 < Hjax> bovard, but there was ants after that
21:04 < Hjax> which was a new competition
21:04 < u___> lol bovard yeah they messed up with the overkill mechanic, it should be diagonal as well
21:04 < u___> as it stands, barely any strategy in it
21:04 < bovard> yeah, doesn't really have much depth
21:04 < Hjax> i was only like 14 when i played planetwars, i was first learning to program, i was legitimately terrible
21:04 < Hjax> it was a ton of fun anyway
21:05 < bovard> haha, did you look at my code? worst stuff I think I've ever written
21:05 < u___> the best design is probably just determine troop allocation at border + move from interior to border to satisfy that
21:05 < Hjax> oh theres a webgame like halite
21:05 < Hjax> called generals.io
21:05 < VeniVidiVici> generals.io is the shit
21:05 < bovard> http://generals.io/
21:05 < VeniVidiVici> needs to become more popular
21:05 < bovard> yeah halite should have just used generals
21:06 < VeniVidiVici> so people stop sucking
21:06 < bovard> lol
21:06 < Hjax> VeniVidiVici, im pretty good, 90 something star
21:06 < bovard> every time I play I just want to make an AI for it
21:06 < Hjax> i got bored and stopped playing
21:06 < VeniVidiVici> i was around that when i stopped a few weeks ago
21:06 < Hjax> bovard, people did, sora.ai is pretty good
21:06 < VeniVidiVici> i came back yesterday and beat sora ai a bit to get 100+
21:06 < VeniVidiVici> but i haven't played since
21:07 < tesu> hello i'm having a weird issue with my ide
21:07 < Hjax> i used to beat sora by abusing a bug in its defense
21:07 < tesu> its marking getVictoryPointCost as an invalid function but the robot compiles just fine
21:07 < Hjax> it was fun
21:07 < VeniVidiVici> i don't think sora is actually very good
21:07 < VeniVidiVici> its defense is terrible
21:07 < VeniVidiVici> just lets you take everything as long as it doesn't immediately lose
21:07 < Hjax> they made its defense better at some point
21:07 < Hjax> it used to be much better
21:07 < Hjax> worse*
21:08 < VeniVidiVici> so i just ran around its general in circles while it was too scared to move lol
21:08 < Hjax> lol
21:08 < Hjax> whats your username in generals?
21:08 < VeniVidiVici> alexthekat
21:08 < VeniVidiVici> it's like 40th now
21:08 < Hjax> yeah i dont think weve played
21:08 < Hjax> im 74th
21:09 < VeniVidiVici> nice
21:09 < VeniVidiVici> now i have to play again
21:09 < VeniVidiVici> you reminded me
21:09 < VeniVidiVici> rip the battlecode
21:09 < Hjax> XD
21:09 < u___> wow generals.io is fun
21:09 < u___> and the art style is nice and old school
21:09 < bovard> Anyway, I'll bring up hiding the auto-matchmaking ranks after the seeding tournament with the other devs, I think that would solve a lot of issues.
21:09 < kodomodo> @tesu rip
21:09 < gongy> anybody lese's scrimmages not loading?
21:09 < bovard> As far as seeding for the seeding, I daresay this will be the most accurately ranked year we've ever had.
21:09 < gongy> also fuck my life we just lost 5 in a row
21:09 < kodomodo> ^^^^
21:09 < tfk> it makes you wonder
21:09 < u___> cmon people join generals!
21:09 < Hjax> bovard, how about you reveal to each team their own rank, but not display the leaderboard
21:09 < tfk> if the seeding tournament has purpose
21:09 < tfk> ;)
21:10 < tfk> Sprint 2.0
21:10 < kodomodo> s/5/30
21:10 < bovard> tfk you mean, besides giving the devs a chance to hit stuff with the nerf bat?
21:10 < tfk> yea
21:10 < bovard> tfk also EVERYONE gets to see some high quality games
21:11 < tfk> only talking about the specific purpose of getting seeded
21:11 < bovard> ah, lol
21:11 < tfk> obv more tournaments is more fun
21:11 < bovard> Alright I'm out, laters!

21:16 < Hjax> i see
21:16 < zxqfl> mhm
21:16 < Hjax> i dont think ive played vs him
21:17 < zxqfl> he said some guys on the generals discord were talking about battlecode
21:17 < zxqfl> was that you?
21:17 < Hjax> zxqfl, i was the one who told them about battlecode
21:17 < gongy> this is rather concerning
21:17 < Hjax> a few people seemed pretty excited, since they were writing ais for generals already
21:17 < gongy> this game is really non transitive
21:17 < gongy> we can beat higher ranked teams but get rekt by rushes from lower
21:18 < zxqfl> i'm surprised generals AIs can't beat top players
21:18 < zxqfl> but i don't really understand the deeper strategy of the game
21:18 < Hjax> zxqfl, it turns out defending is really hard
21:18 < Hjax> the search space is too large to apply traditional minimax based search
21:18 < Hjax> think of it like go, with hundreds of legal moves per turn
21:18 < Hjax> lookahead is pretty limited
21:19 < Hjax> and half a second of thinking time
21:19 < zxqfl> that makes sense
21:19 < zxqfl> i wonder if halite bots could be adapted
21:19 < gongy> how often does auto matchmaking happen
21:19 < Hjax> halite is different because you can move everything at once
21:19 < Hjax> gongy, once every 20 minutes is what ive seen
21:20 < gongy> kk ty
21:20 < zxqfl> yeah i suppose that's a huge difference
21:22 < whaack> what are the good ways to tell if your on the edge of the map
21:22 < CertifiedPyro> rc.onTheMap
21:22 < whaack> like if your bot can see the ege of the map does it have a way of knowing there's an edge?

21:36 < VeniVidiVici> i don't think we've played anyone in rank [5,15] recently lol
21:38 < darthjarjar> we won 7 out of 8 then have lost 4 in a row
21:38 < darthjarjar> didn't change our bot
21:38 < darthjarjar> so much variance haha
21:38 < darthjarjar> based on maps and matchups

21:41 < gongy> being consitetntly somewhere is what is meant to happen...
21:42 < VeniVidiVici> yeah that part is fine
21:42 < gongy> what isn't meant to happen is being top 10 then dropping to 30th because of dumb matches... and still beating high ranked teams
21:42 < VeniVidiVici> but we haven't had a match we couldn't predict the result of in a while :P
21:42 < gongy> fair enough
21:42 < gongy> we got stuck in elo hell for a bit

21:48 < CertifiedPyro> just bad seed
21:48 < CertifiedPyro> keep in mind that people with <10 autorank matches are seeded lower than people with 10+ autorank matches
21:48 < gongy> kodomodo, yeah, but i also need lumberjacks and scouts and gardeners and trees
21:48 < gongy> :(
21:48 < Hjax> VeniVidiVici, you are water buffalo right?
21:48 < gongy> so hard to balance fml
21:49 < VeniVidiVici> yep
21:49 < Hjax> we are playing :-)
21:49 < VeniVidiVici> we lose these maps
21:49 < gongy> lol
21:49 < Hjax> VeniVidiVici, we do too
21:49 < Hjax> lets see who loses harder
21:50 < emabrey> ive been focused on my open source stuff recently and I just realized I should prolly start working on this competition lol
21:51 < gongy> damn i would respect that
21:51 < gongy> we missed 3 days and we are already so screwed >.<
21:53 < VeniVidiVici> hjax that has to be the lowest quality match i've seen recently lol
21:53 < VeniVidiVici> we suck equally
21:53 < VeniVidiVici> excellent
21:53 < Hjax> VeniVidiVici, our gardener got really confused game 2
21:54 < VeniVidiVici> yeah that was very strange
21:54 < Hjax> and didnt build a tree
21:54 < VeniVidiVici> somehow your soldier went off and 2v1ed us
21:54 < VeniVidiVici> you got a tank on turn like 200
21:54 < Hjax> VeniVidiVici, it was in a tree
21:54 < Hjax> that we chopped down
21:54 < VeniVidiVici> yeah
21:54 < VeniVidiVici> but like
21:54 < VeniVidiVici> a tank is a tank :P
21:54 < CertifiedPyro> so, is starting with 2 soldiers the new meta?
21:54 < Hjax> CertifiedPyro, thats what we do
21:54 < VeniVidiVici> you trapped yourself somehow i guess
21:55 < kodomodo> thats how we roll
21:55 < kodomodo> or how we should be rolling
21:55 < CertifiedPyro> i've seen a bunch of people do it
21:55 < CertifiedPyro> cause the old "send a scout to kill the gardener" thing doesn't work anymore
21:55 < VeniVidiVici> we usually double soldier start yeah
21:55 < gongy> wtf is the point of soldiers going to 0.95
21:56 < gongy> can't dodge bullets anymore?
21:56 < gongy> is that the idea
21:56 < CertifiedPyro> it makes dodging not reliant on random floating point errors
21:56 < gongy> what do you mean?
21:57 < CertifiedPyro> since soldier body radius and stride radius were the same, if you moved perpendicular to a bullet and it hit the very edge, whether it hit depended on floating point
21:59 < kodomodo> now it means you get hit if you try that
21:59 < kodomodo> they could have made the stride 1.05, but dodging is overrated apparently

23:22 < u___> too easy to make some bad setup where you're trapped

23:30 < tfk> team rocket
23:30 < tfk> has taken over the scrimmage server
23:30 < tfk> ! D:
23:30 < zxqfl> !
23:30 < tfk> yea that's artillary
23:30 < tfk> from 2013
23:30 < tfk> lol
23:31 < zxqfl> oh lol
23:33 < u___> i remember grumpycat always built an artillery on the first encampment between his HQ and the enemies, to stop rushes
23:34 < u___> aside from that they werent used a whole lot
23:34 < dmhacker> What would be a good way to tackle bullet avoidance?
23:34 < tfk> I mean
23:34 < tfk> in 2013 artillary took a long time to beat
23:34 < tfk> I was so happy
23:34 < u___> you just waited for critical mass and rushed in right?
23:34 < u___> or no
23:34 < tfk> yea
23:34 < u___> you used shields maybe
23:34 < u___> i dont remember
23:34 < tfk> but it took a long time to figure out how to adapt to artillary
23:34 < u___> man 2013 was awesome
23:34 < tfk> yea 2013 is my favorite year
23:35 < tfk> haha

23:37 < dmhacker> Hows life been?
23:37 < Hjax> great, i was a high school student when i was playing robotgame, in my second year of college now, graduating next year
23:38 < dmhacker> I saw on your bio :D nice
23:39 < dmhacker> Your bot is doing quite well congratz
23:39 < Hjax> tbh i dont feel like i am that much better at programming now than i was when i played robotgame
23:39 < Hjax> yeah, me and my roommate are teammates
23:39 < Hjax> so its easy to collaborate
23:39 < dmhacker> Lucky
23:39 < dmhacker> Im the only one whose working on our bot xd
23:39 < Hjax> ^ that was me last year
23:40 < dmhacker> haha
23:40 < Hjax> printf super stepped up his contributions this year
23:40 < Hjax> we are trying to fix as many bugs as possible before tomorrow
23:40 < dmhacker> Gotcha same
23:40 < tfk> yea the printf change is nice
23:40 < Hjax> our ranking on the server appears to have dropped, we were as high as rank 2 at some point
23:41 < dmhacker> I saw you guys as high as number 5 at some point
23:41 < dmhacker> So nice job :D
23:42 < kodomodo> how are people coding sparse farms?
23:42 < Hjax> dmhacker, my teammate made our dodging code, his description is: "it simulates repeated vector fields to approximate the best place to move to"
23:42 < Hjax> yeah im happy we are doing pretty well
23:42 < Hjax> trying to get top 16 TT
23:42 < dmhacker> xd
23:42 < dmhacker> Im pursuing a more aggressive strategy and it seems to be working well
23:42 < dmhacker> And that sounds pretty fancy; was considering using a vector field
23:43 < Hjax> dmhacker, he REALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY likes vector fields
23:43 < dmhacker> xD
23:43 < Hjax> "its the cure-all"
23:43 < dmhacker> Vector fields are fun
23:43 < dmhacker> I really have to stop treating the game more continuously
23:43 < dmhacker> Im really just making a discrete action space out of a continuous one
23:44 < VeniVidiVici> our bot makes me so sad
23:44 < Hjax> vectors are nice for that, or at least my teammate says so
23:44 < VeniVidiVici> it's just so dumb :(
23:44 < dmhacker> xD
23:44 < emabrey> how do you know the match is over
23:44 < VeniVidiVici> every time i think we fixed something
23:44 < Hjax> VeniVidiVici, our bot gets worse every time we touch it
23:44 < VeniVidiVici> it does something else dumber than the last thing
23:44 < Hjax> but then if you go back, it was already doing the dumber thing too
23:44 < Hjax> you just didnt notice
23:45 < Hjax> backwards forward progress
23:45 < tfk> yea
23:45 < tfk> self-testing is kinda tricky
23:45 < dmhacker> pretty much my bot too when making bug fixes lol
23:45 < tfk> you can get stuck in a rut
23:46 < tfk> where you can't have the machinery to implement better behavior without first decreasing your performance (since your stupid behavior happened to result in okay results)
23:47 < battlecode964> real
23:48 < kodomodo> are sparseforests better than hexagons?
23:48 < tfk> I'm not sure how they could be
23:48 < tfk> after spending time with them...
23:48 < kodomodo> they allow for easy movement
23:48 < kodomodo> no getting stuck
23:48 < tfk> yea but density isn't high enough
23:48 < tfk> you get similar desnity with hives
23:48 < kodomodo> the ability to spread is high
23:48 < tfk> you can spread out hives...
23:48 < tfk> idk
23:49 < tfk> maybe I just couldn't figure out how to do it right
23:49 < kodomodo> and maybe I just can't figure out how to do hives right
23:49 < kodomodo> the grass is greener on the other side
23:49 < tfk> yea
23:49 < tfk> The sparse layout is nice looking
23:49 < kodomodo> ^^
23:49 < tfk> I really wanted to make it work
23:49 < tfk> and its easier I think to replace gardeners
23:49 < kodomodo> that is true
23:50 < tfk> I still got stuck though
23:50 < tfk> units piled up
23:50 < u___> easier to "replace" gardeners cause all the trouble is with assigning gardeners in the first place
23:50 < Hjax> so my team uses Trainers
23:50 < kodomodo> ?
23:50 < tfk> yea that's what I kinda meant
23:50 < Hjax> we assign gardeners to the role of building units
23:50 < u___> was a nightmare when i tried to do it
23:50 < tfk> you can just spread out gardeners
23:50 < Hjax> and other gardeners build trees
23:50 < tfk> like springs
23:50 < u___> yeah
23:50 < tfk> idk I'll see how things look in seeding
23:50 < tfk> maybe I'll try it again if top teams are using sparse layouts
23:50 < u___> actually hm
23:51  * kodomodo actually hmms
23:51 < u___> i didn't consider just having low health trees be springs too
23:51 < u___> maybe with that it would work ok
23:51 < Hjax> springs?
23:51 < tfk> well I did hardcoded stuff
23:51 < tfk> in my testing
23:52 < tfk> but a nice way to think about gardeners
23:52 < tfk> is you have a cloud of gardeners
23:52 < tfk> connected to their neighbors
23:52 < tfk> via a spring
23:52 < tfk> to keep them together
23:52 < tfk> and they just build trees
23:52 < tfk> lose a gardener
23:52 < tfk> tension decreases a little
23:52 < tfk> and you spread out
23:52 < tfk> until you get more
23:53 < tfk> lol *nice way to think about it* might not actually be a "good" way to think about it :)
23:53 < u___> yeah lol
23:54 < u___> mine were more like electrons

00:02 < emabrey> whats the correct way to run code at the end of the match rounds in order to do something like run setTeamMemory() ?

00:10 < zxqfl> can anyone think of a use for the team memory? i can't
00:10 < zxqfl> since so much is dependent on the map
00:11 < kodomodo> whether they sent a scout or not
00:11 < u___> zxqfl: it was more relevant in previous years when rush was the main question
00:11 < u___> there you go :P
00:11 < kodomodo> whether they led with scouts or soldiers
00:11 < u___> i didn't even know it still existed, never even tried it
00:11 < kodomodo> their tree formation
00:11 < u___> that hardly seems useful but ok
00:11 < kodomodo> i know
00:12 < u___> the scout thing is smart though.. also, whether *your* initial scout rush was worth the effort
00:12 < zxqfl> i guess there are uses, but i can't see myself changing the bot's behaviour based on this info
00:12 < u___> yeah i dont think many people ever use it
00:12 < kodomodo> the only tihng I could see changing is initial spawns
00:12 < zxqfl> seems to me like the main use of a scout is to pick up bullets
00:12 < u___> you don't know how you want to use it until the meta is decided
00:12 < u___> and at that point you're just too busy doing other finishing touches

01:52 < cbrenci> or is there maybe a better method to use?  If all I want to do is sense if there's anything at all within radius r of some location
01:54 < aishair> there is another same function which does not take in a team
01:54 < aishair> just a radius

02:45 < madan> Hi I have a question
02:45 < CertifiedPyro> yes?
02:46 < madan> Is clock keep count of turn or the function like plantTree, hireGardner keep the tunr updated
02:46 < madan> turns
02:47 < CertifiedPyro> I'm sort of confused. Are you asking how to keep track of the round number? because you can do that with rc.getRoundNum()
02:48 < madan> No, Ex I have code where I call stack of method like (createRobot, plantTree etc called one after the other), then I call clock
02:49 < madan> now I wanted to know is turn count updated by clock or those method
02:50 < CertifiedPyro> if i understand what you're asking, the only thing that updates turn count is when you call Clock.yield()
02:51 < Leucosia> madan - the battlecode server keeps track of each time something is built or planted or attacked during the current round - the Clock.yield tells the server that you are ready for your code during this round to be over (let the next player take their turn)
02:52 -!- Gullesnuffs [02469adb@gateway/web/freenode/ip.2.70.154.219] has joined #battlecode
02:53 < madan> ok, If a player never calls Clock.yield() or take time to return will cause delay or game failed to complete.
02:53 < madan> I am right

10:58 < madan> Hello I have question, When we call chop does lumberjack moves to the location and perform action or we need to move then call chop
10:58 < Leucosia> move, then chop
10:59 < Leucosia> when in approximately the right place, use rc.canInteractWithTree to see if you will be able to reach it
11:00 < madan> ok, so you are saying to first move and chop, by using can interactWithTree to find I am in location to chop
11:01 < madan> Am I right
11:01 < madan> ?
11:02 < Leucosia> if not close to tree, move, then if I think I'm close to tree, call interactWithTree to make sure before attempting to chop
11:03 < Leucosia> sorry I wasn't clear before
11:03 < madan> ok got it, thanks #Leucosia
11:04 < Leucosia> np :)

13:10 < u___> it has a bug where if one gardener can't build a hive... it just builds nothing but gardeners forever

15:57 < tfk> its just elo
15:57 < tfk> with little dampening
15:57 < tfk> so its unbounded
15:57 < tfk> (or maybe bounded by 3000 or something)
15:58 < hjax> is elo typically bounded?
15:58 < hjax> i thought elo was just straight relative performance
15:58 < hjax> 100 elo = ~65% performance or something
15:58 -!- u___ [~u_@mobile-130-126-255-213.near.illinois.edu] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]

15:58 < tfk> beating #2 won't cause any change
15:59 < tfk> parameters of elo formula determine limit
15:59 < tfk> idk what they are for battlecode
15:59 < tfk> common defaults have limits of 3400
15:59 < tfk> I think
15:59 < oak_disciple> but that depends on the amount of teams
15:59 < oak_disciple> doesnt it?
15:59 < tfk> no
16:00 < tfk> you beat #2
16:00 < tfk> and no increase to your elo
16:00 < oak_disciple> I mean, if there are more teams, chances are that #2 will have more elo
16:00 < tfk> yea but there's still an upper bound
16:00 < tfk> unless I'm misremembering wildly
16:01 < tfk> My guess is upper bound is around 3400
16:01 < tfk> since I recall that around 3,000 teams get like almost no elo
16:02 < tfk> and 3400 is, if I recall correctly, upper bound with common defaults

16:03 < CertifiedPyro> hello!
16:03 < tfk> hello!
16:03 < CertifiedPyro> looks like the recently uploaded bots are pretty good, i've dropped down a bit
16:03 < zxqfl> seems like the tank meta hasn't quite arrived
16:04 < hjax> zxqfl, team 25 is working hard to bring the tank meta to a seeding tournament near you
16:04 < CertifiedPyro> god, it's so hard to make a nice grid with gardeners
16:04 < battlecode194> floating point errors ruin everything!
16:05 < zxqfl> looking forward to it hjax
16:05 < battlecode194> should've made the trees radius 0.999
16:05 < zxqfl> we'll be building them as soon as we figure out how to do so without bulldozing our own trees
16:05 < tfk> yea
16:05 < tfk> main issue I had with grid
16:05 < hjax> zxqfl, we need to build a fancy tree grid like yours at some point
16:05 < tfk> was difficulty with tanks
16:05 < hjax> right now we dont
16:06 < zxqfl> i dunno how fancy it is, it's really not that efficient on eg. barrier
16:06 < ashdnazg> they've made a song about my team's ranking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lWJXDG2i0A
16:06 < hjax> zxqfl, your watering is pretty fancy
16:06 < zxqfl> the main advantage for us is that we rarely block ourselves in
16:06 < zxqfl> oh, yeah i guess so
16:07 < oak_disciple> my team knows a lot about tree grids, we make the best grids :D
16:07 < CertifiedPyro> yeah, same ashdnazg

16:08 < oak_disciple> hello!
16:08 < hjax> yeah we lose soldier duels to them too
16:08 < hjax> we win sometimes
16:09 < battlecode194> usually trading equally with most of the other top contenders
16:09 < battlecode194> but theyre doing something different it seems
16:10 < oak_disciple> is it possible that they take into consideration bullets that will hit in more than 1 turn? or is someone else doing that already?
16:10 < battlecode596> do their soldiers seem to coordinate?
16:10 < hjax> oak_disciple, idk who has enough bytecode for that
16:10 < battlecode194> hmm, I do that too if I have the bytecodes to spare
16:10 < battlecode194> but yeah usually theres not enough
16:10 < CertifiedPyro> are people still doing hextrees?
16:11 < battlecode194> they may have some clever tricks that allow doing that within the bytecode limits
16:11 < oak_disciple> hjax Our soldiers use only about 6k bytecodes so maybe we can implement that
16:11 < battlecode194> this game would look so different at 15000 bytecodes
16:11 < hjax> my team uses an iterative dodge code
16:11 < oak_disciple> CertifiedPyro my team is doing trees in a square shape
16:11 < hjax> so we run more iterations if we have enough bytecode
16:12 < CertifiedPyro> hmm...alright. I'm trying to build hextrees in a grid, but it's not that good right now, lol
16:12 < battlecode194> yeah kind of the same deal here
16:12 < battlecode194> putting all of my spare bytecodes in movement
16:12 < oak_disciple> hmm we tell the code the bytecode limit that we don't want to get past and it cuts the obstacle checking before that
16:14 < battlecode194> perhaps theres some clever algorithm out there somehow that can come up with a good dodge spot without just looping through spots+bullets..
16:14 < oak_disciple> damn, we just lost 2-0 vs arbitrary because our two soldiers got killed by only one of his, in both games
16:15 < battlecode194> :/
16:15 < battlecode194> did he have a positioning advantage?
16:15 < battlecode194> like where your soldiers were behind each other or something
16:15 < oak_disciple> in the first game it was in the open, and in the second one our soldiers were coming from opposite directions

16:17 < oak_disciple> I think he tries to escape one of the soldiers to get in a 1v1, win it and then win the second 1v1
16:18 < battlecode194> ive noticd them seemingly pushing my soldiers into bad terrain

16:37 < battlecode194> well a lot of teams got a lot better too, so that may be it too veni
16:37 < battlecode194> its quite a difference
16:38 < slight> hey im making the jar uploading for the first time from intellij
16:38 < slight> 1) how am i making the jar? do i just double click "jarforupload"?
16:38 < battlecode194> yep
16:38 < oak_disciple> I figure that teams will stop improving as fast as now, not as many things to fix as before
16:38 < slight> i did that and it looks like it ran properly, where is the jar created im not finding it :/
16:38 < CertifiedPyro> it's created in the battlecode folder

16:39 < deinFreund> is there any penalty for disabling automatic match making?
16:39 < deinFreund> or will you keep your current points?
16:40 < oak_disciple> you keep your points
16:40 < CertifiedPyro> as long as you have >10 matches, pretty sure there's no penalty?
16:40 < VeniVidiVici> no, but i *think* (not sure if this is actually happening) that teams will play some # of matches after lock
16:40 < deinFreund> ok thx!
16:40 < ashdnazg> deinFreund: what are you plotting?
16:40 < oak_disciple> maybe a dev can confirm it?
16:41 < battlecode194> probably not much of a point in disabling now anyway

16:42 <@bovard> need to keep it enabled though

16:43 < slight> so it looks like the jarForUpload made a jar with all of my players, rather than the one player i thought i had submitted, any tips?

16:43 < tfk> just specify package

17:01 < whaack> is there  a bug in the bullet generation? How can someone reach 10,000 bullets if they only have 45 trees?

17:01 < VeniVidiVici> yeah there's some lag issues with some people i think
17:01 < VeniVidiVici> the server is also not the greatest
17:01 < guest234ui> bovard what time are the post submission games gonna run?
17:01 < tfk> there seems to be some bugs causing server/client crash
17:01 <@bovard> submissions extended for 10 mins
17:01 < VeniVidiVici> @whaack: that's 90 bullets/round
17:01 < VeniVidiVici> 300 rounds you can get 27k
17:01 < guest234ui> so right after the deadline?
17:02 < oak_disciple> I thought trees gave 1 bullet per turn, not 2
17:02 < battlecode847> does it have to be submitted by deadline or just queued?
17:02 <@bovard> just queued
17:03 < oak_disciple> nvm you're right, its 2 bullets per tree
17:03 < battlecode847> cool
17:03 < battlecode847> cause its taking forever
17:03 < whaack> yeah shouldn't it be 46 bullets per round? so if i have 4600 bullets how can i gain anymore bullets?
17:03 < VeniVidiVici> ?
17:03 < VeniVidiVici> the next round you'd go from 4600 to 4646
17:03 < oak_disciple> whaack Trees don't give less bullets the more bullets you have, that's only the passive bullets
17:03 < VeniVidiVici> well 4690
17:03 < DeinFreund> whaack: the reduction only applies to the 2 income
17:03 < VeniVidiVici> oh yes
17:04 < VeniVidiVici> you get 2 - (your bullets)/100 for free

17:34 < hjax> oak_disciple, we shuffle around a lot in the ratings
17:34 < hjax> sometimes we are rank 3
17:34 < hjax> sometimes we are rank 20
17:34 < hjax> we lost a majority of our games to waterloo and bruteforcer
17:35 < battlecode194> youve been taking some from me recently!
17:35 < hjax> a few. but you beat us way more often :P

17:36 < battlecode194> sounds good to me
17:36 < hjax> yeah they beat my team consistently
17:36 < hjax> weve won a series or two
17:36 < hjax> and lost like 10
17:36 < zxqfl> same here
17:36 < zxqfl> last win against them was before i woke up today, several losses since then

17:39 < VeniVidiVici> upload buggy old bot
17:39 < VeniVidiVici> win 6 matches in row

18:27 < neeca> that's tau*i :p

19:55 < CertifiedPyro> it has to do with how i'm setting up my gardeners, it's still not that smart

20:01 < whaack> is the tournament bracket up anywhere?

20:17 < battletoad255> i think the best thing to do is monitor if you have become stuck and try something new after awhile
20:17 < battletoad255> not just with gardner layout, but in general
20:18 < CertifiedPyro> yeah, true
20:19 < battletoad255> like when some archons were pinned in during the last tournament, notice you aren't doing anything productive at all after awhile and start something new
20:19 < CertifiedPyro> you can generally just choose a "leader" archon at the beginning based on the surroundings of the archons
20:19 < battletoad255> easier said than done
20:20 < CertifiedPyro> ehh, not really. to check if you're completely trapped, see if you can't move in any direction. to see if you're in a cramped spot, check a bunch of circles around the archon to see if they're clear
20:23 < battletoad255> the hard part is detecting that you aren't progressing, figuring out why (or just skipping that and guessing/random) and figuring out what you can do differently than you are doing
20:23 < battletoad255> easy looking at one case where we know the problem and solution, like being pinned in

22:42 < hjax> matthewpipie, being able to have 7 is pretty easy to imagine
22:42 < hjax> some teams do that
22:42 < hjax> you have to move a bit to plant the trees

22:58 < kodomodo> well you can plant 6 trees around you without moving at angles of 60 degrees
22:58 < kodomodo> so if you pick one spot and make that the spawn spot, that's 5 trees

23:00 < kodomodo> @zxqfl against what team did you and Bruteforcer have the bytecode bug?
23:01 < zxqfl> air force zero
23:03 < matthewpipie> @kodomodo thanks!
23:04 < kodomodo> air force zero H4X0RZ confirmed
23:05 < battlecode593> so you can plant 7 if you move a bit, 6 all the way around you, or 5 if you leave room to spawn soldiers... if i'm reading all that correctly
23:06 -!- kahkeng [49bd28bc@gateway/web/cgi-irc/kiwiirc.com/ip.73.189.40.188] has joined #battlecode
23:06 < CertifiedPyro> yes
23:06 < CertifiedPyro> people sometimes do 8 trees by planting them in a square as well
23:06 < tfk> can you water all 7 without moving?
23:07 < tfk> I haven't checked the water distance in awhile
23:07 < tfk> like since day 1
23:07 < tfk> x_x
23:07 < CertifiedPyro> trees have to be within distance 1 to water
23:07 < tfk> from edge?
23:07 < CertifiedPyro> so i think that means 2 from the center?
23:07 < tfk> ah interesting
23:07 < tfk> yea
23:08 < tfk> probably tight hexagon isn't that good
23:08 < CertifiedPyro> Oh yeah it is, you use INTERACTION_DIST_FROM_EDGE to find it out
23:08 < tfk> should change my gardening code
23:08 < CertifiedPyro> tight hexagon is alright, it just means you can't really escape
23:08 < tfk> exactly
23:09 < tfk> and its awkward to replace gardeners
23:09 < tfk> would be better to have space for two gardeners
23:09 < CertifiedPyro> you can try the square formation and see if it helps
23:09 < battlecode593> i kind of liked max's idea of city streets
23:10 < tfk> I think I might just try slightly expanded hexagon
23:10 < kodomodo> that is a nice idea
23:10 < tfk> maybe I'll try squares...
23:10 < CertifiedPyro> yeah, i believe Waterloo does a variation of the grid
23:10 < kodomodo> are sparse forests overrated now?
23:10 < tfk> I don't think sparse forests work
23:11 < tfk> I guess we'll see  tomorrow
23:11 < kodomodo> ^^
23:11 < tfk> but I can't think of any reason why they are good
23:11 < tfk> lol
23:11 < battlecode593> if your gardeners could walk the streets with other units they could water as they go
23:11 < VeniVidiVici> what is a sparse forest
23:11 < kodomodo> wcgw's thing
23:11 < tfk> I really liked it when I first saw it
23:11 < tfk> but I don't think it makes sense
23:11 < kodomodo> instead of hexagons, they build trees a set distance from each other
23:12 < VeniVidiVici> like in no pattern?
23:12 < kodomodo> hold on
23:12 < tfk> they like lay down a grid over the map
23:12 < tfk> with build locations
23:12 < tfk> (or at least you can think of it like that)
23:12 < VeniVidiVici> isn't that what waterloo was doing

23:13 < kodomodo> look at the second battle, round 1000 or so
23:13 < VeniVidiVici> oh ok
23:13 < VeniVidiVici> waterloo had some like
23:13 < VeniVidiVici> put trees at every (odd,odd) coordinate or something
23:13 < kodomodo> yup
23:13 < VeniVidiVici> which seemed cute
23:13 < tfk> its really impressive honestly
23:13 < kodomodo> i think wcgw just has a min distance btwn trees
23:14 < tfk> especially gardener watering
23:14 < VeniVidiVici> but we rejected it after realizing a) it was hard to write and b) our units get stuck on the passcal map so we probably dont' want to try that :P
23:14 < tfk> I implemented it
23:14 < VeniVidiVici> maybe we could try (3x,3y) or something
23:14 < tfk> main issue is that units still get stuck
23:14 < tfk> lol
23:14 < VeniVidiVici> yeah it sounds hard to make work
23:14 < tfk> also the density is not higher
23:14 < tfk> than hexagons
23:14 < tfk> spaced out
23:14 < VeniVidiVici> we stopped trying because scouts were winning everything anyway
23:14 < VeniVidiVici> maybe worth trying again idk
23:15 < tfk> like why have a grid take up a big space
23:15 < tfk> instead of just having the same number of trees in the middle of that big space
23:15 < VeniVidiVici> well the main advantage seemed to be you avoid blocking yourself
23:15 < kodomodo> yeah I can't really tell how they programmed that
23:15 < battlecode593> if you do it right, you can use it to block the other player
23:15 < kodomodo> and yeah, our main problem with hexagons is we block ourselves in
23:16 < kodomodo> it might be a good idea to have our archon move lol
23:16 < VeniVidiVici> we also have trouble making hexagons for some reason lol
23:16 < VeniVidiVici> if we try to build at 60 degree angles it won't make 6
23:16 < CertifiedPyro> hmm...really?
23:16 < tfk> I think I just make 4
23:16 < VeniVidiVici> but everyone else has said it works fine
23:16 < tfk> I didn't use angles though
23:17 < kodomodo> @VeniVidiVici do you use radians or degress
23:17 < VeniVidiVici> radians i think
23:18 < kodomodo> I do "dir = dir.rotateLeftDegrees(60)" in a loop. works fine
23:18 < VeniVidiVici> hmm
23:18 < kodomodo> maybe rounding errors
23:18 < VeniVidiVici> maybe we try that again
23:18 < VeniVidiVici> have bigger issues to solve anyway :P

23:36 < tfk> huh?
23:36 < tfk> no
23:36 < tfk> I saw a soldier
23:36 < kindle> the lumberjacks/archons disappeared too lol
23:36 < tfk> moving
23:36 < tfk> and it disappeared
23:36 < CertifiedPyro> later on, they disappeared as soon as they spawned
23:37 < tfk> ah yes you are right
23:37 < tfk> how recent was this match?

23:38 < tfk> do you usually print to console?

23:40 < tfk> you should email devs...
23:40 < kindle> found another instance of this occuring against air force zero lol
23:40 < tfk> I think there may be some bugs in server
23:40 < tfk> I've had some unexplained issues with my testing setup
23:40 < tfk> matches completely failing at a fixed round
23:40 < tfk> stuff like that
23:40 < tfk> (when running headless)
23:41 < tfk> ah
23:41 < tfk> what about robot ids
23:41 < tfk> any pattern there?
23:42 < CertifiedPyro> wait tfk, you're having errors even when not going against air force?
23:42 < tfk> I have matches that completely stall
23:42 < tfk> they're not slow
23:42 < tfk> they just stop at a fixed round
23:42 < tfk> its only on maps with lots of units
23:43 < CertifiedPyro> ahh, maybe that's what's causing it?
23:43 < tfk> I wonder about robot ids for that reason (and maybe they're giving ids for bullets?)
23:43 < CertifiedPyro> bullets definitely have IDs
23:45 < tfk> yea... email devs
23:45 < tfk> haha
23:45 < tfk> srsly
23:45 < tfk> just in case
23:45 < tfk> don't want this happening in tournament
23:46 <@dinosaurs> the devs figured out what was causing it - so it's fixed for tomorrow
23:46 < CertifiedPyro> ah, ok. ty :)
23:46 < tfk> oh good
23:46 <@dinosaurs> thanks for all the reports!
23:47 < tfk> Panic! D:
23:47 < kindle> oh :D thanks
23:47 < CertifiedPyro> btw, i think i found something cheeky i can do to people who use rc.senseBroadcastingRobotLocations() :)
23:48 < tfk> really?
23:49 < tfk> doesn't seem very exploitable to me
23:49 < CertifiedPyro> it can if that player checks through the entire array
23:49 < tfk> oh
23:49 < tfk> haha
23:49 < tfk> oh yea I do that too
23:49 < tfk> all my robots broadcast
23:49 < tfk> probably shouldn't do that...
23:50 < CertifiedPyro> it's definitely possible to overwhelm the other player if you spam broadcasts
23:50 < CertifiedPyro> but i don't think very many people use it though
23:51 < tfk> people who use it probably have to handle that case anyways
23:51 < tfk> I think lots of folks broadcast every round
23:51 < zxqfl> wouldn't you need a ton of robots for that?
23:51 < tfk> or... at least I do - without intent of overwhelming anyone
23:52 < zxqfl> all our robots broadcast every round too
23:52 < zxqfl> seems like you'd need at least 50 robots or so to overwhelm them
23:52 < CertifiedPyro> zxqfl nope, every single broadcast is sent into that array, even if its the same robot at the same location
23:52 < globalpointer> whaaat
23:52 < tfk> wait really? that seems against the method spec
23:52 < zxqfl> whatt
23:52 < CertifiedPyro> yeah, i just tried it out
23:52 < globalpointer> that's horrifying
23:52 < tfk> ah...
23:53 < tfk> well I see why they do that
23:53 < tfk> because you could switch rounds
23:53 < tfk> deduping would be annoying
23:53 < zxqfl> we might do this DDOS unintentionally
23:54 < tfk> or you could broadcast, then move

00:02 < kodomodo> they block IRC at work too
00:02 < tfk> you're safe
00:02 < tfk> just don't spoil the result for yourself
00:02 < kodomodo> ideally I could watch it and be on here at the same time
00:02 < tfk> where do you work?
00:02 < kodomodo> but nooooo I have to make powerpoints and research security

00:06 < CertifiedPyro> Ignore what I said about spamming broadcasts earlier, turns out I tested wrong. Each robot can only add one entry to rc.senseBroadcastingLocations(), regardless of # of broadcasts
00:07 < tfk> is it final location?
00:07 < tfk> not that it really matters much, just curiosu
00:07 < battlecode706> Should be rc.getLocation()
00:07 < battlecode706> location before move
00:08 < CertifiedPyro> testing it right now

00:11 < tfk> punny
00:11  * CertifiedPyro chuckles
00:15 < MiloATH> Any predictions for best strategy in the seeding? I saw Many Interesting Titrations have a kind of cool tank rush strategy I think will do well
00:16 < hjax> i think my team beats theirs consistently
00:16 < CertifiedPyro> on small maps, whoever has the best offensive rush wins
00:16 < MiloATH> Even on bigger maps, the strategy works. They even disintegrate their own archon

00:18 < MiloATH> I should've combined my strategy with a rush strategy for smaller maps. Too late now. I will have to wait. :(
00:19 < MiloATH> Soldier rush does really well.
00:19 < MiloATH> The only problem I can see is with teams that make to many soldiers.
00:20 < CertifiedPyro> ehh, that can be changed easily by tweaking constants
00:20 < MiloATH> With too many soldiers the cost per round of bullet use increase to a point where gardeners can't keep up
00:20 < tfk> yea
00:20 < MiloATH> The math really has to be in the code for it to work well
00:20 < tfk> I still haven't figure out this year's game
00:20 < tfk> its clearly not about # of units
00:21 < MiloATH> The penta shot is really powerful
00:21 < tfk> kinda
00:21 < MiloATH> It will be interesting to see the top teams in the seeding tournament
00:21 < CertifiedPyro> penta shot is powerful until you run out of bullets

00:22 < kodomodo> lmao so titrations does the spawn gardener disitegrate archon thing
00:22 < tfk> ?
00:22 < MiloATH> @CertifiedPyro, ya good point
00:22 < tfk> not in matches I've had with him
00:22 < kodomodo> one round in Little Forts, they didn't spawn anythign and disintegrated archon
00:22 < MiloATH> @Kodomodo ya they do
00:22 < kodomodo> immediate win
00:22 < CertifiedPyro> oh lol
00:22 < MiloATH> lol
00:23 < MiloATH> Sometimes it is smart. Like when the play on the chess map
00:23 < MiloATH> because the first army unit they make is a soldier
00:23 < kodomodo> yeah its gardener -soldier trees tank
00:23 < hjax> i have a maxed out army by the time one tank gets across chess
00:23 < MiloATH> I think it is gardener tree tree soldier tree tree then all tanks
00:24 < MiloATH> They get a tank out ~round 200
00:26 < MiloATH> What do you think of the automated matchmaking?

00:27 < CertifiedPyro> pretty nice, though it sort of suffers from the same problem as ranked scrims
00:27 < CertifiedPyro> people turn it off as soon as they have a good rank
00:27 < MiloATH> If you turn it off doesn't it reset?
00:28 < hjax> dont think so
00:28 < hjax> my team left it on, we are tied for second most auto mm games
00:28 < MiloATH> Man, I should've turned mine off.
00:28 < hjax> third most*
00:29 < hjax> we had 216 games, went 128-88
00:29 < MiloATH> team when I'm GM
00:29 < hjax> yeah
00:30 < zxqfl> i think they shouldn't let you turn it off
00:31 < zxqfl> and you should be able to upload a separate bot for testing in unranked scrims
00:31 < zxqfl> that's a significant structural change though
00:31 < MiloATH> Ya. You could just make another team. But that probably is discouraged.
00:32 < MiloATH> Also they probably hash the jar files to check no one uploads the same bots on multiple teams
00:32 < zxqfl> do the jar files include source? or only .class
00:32 < hjax> the jar files include source
00:32 < MiloATH> The source code can be decumpiled
00:33 < tfk> by running unzip
00:33 < tfk> on the jar
00:33 < tfk> ;)
00:33 < tfk> lol
00:33 < tfk> "decompile"
00:33 < MiloATH> http://www.javadecompilers.com/
00:33 < hjax> i know this because my teammate sent me a jar file with some source code changes that werent on git yet
00:33 < hjax> and i just unzipped it
00:33 < zxqfl> hm
00:33 < zxqfl> so a bytecode optimizing compiler would have to compile from java to java
00:34 < tfk> I don't think bytecode optimizing compiler can work
00:34 < tfk> for battlecode
00:34 < zxqfl> why not?

00:34 < zxqfl> i mean, sure it's more effort than it's worth, but i think you could theoretically build it
00:34 < tfk> oh source to source translation?
00:34 < tfk> that would work fine
00:34 < MiloATH> You aren't sumbitting bytecode
00:34 < zxqfl> yeah
00:34 < MiloATH> oh
00:34 < tfk> I mean
00:34 < tfk> something you can do
00:34 < tfk> is use C preprocessor
00:34 < MiloATH> Isn't there a plugin for that>
00:34 < tfk> haha
00:35 < tfk> #define CONSTANT_VARIABLE value
00:35 < zxqfl> oh god
00:35 < tfk> #define min(a,b) a < b ? a : b
00:35 < zxqfl> that actually sounds pretty useful
00:35 < tfk> yea it is
00:35 < tfk> #define QUEUE_PUSH(q,item)
00:35 < zxqfl> but also pretty horrible
00:35 < tfk> etc.
00:35 < zxqfl> for maintainability
00:35 < tfk> well...
00:35 < tfk> its more maintainable than the alternative
00:35 < tfk> haha
00:36 < zxqfl> true
00:36 < zxqfl> we haven't gotten into the bytecode optimization much yet
00:36 < MiloATH> ^
00:36 < tfk> but yea I don't use it much
00:36 < zxqfl> looking forward to that next week
00:36 < tfk> I used it a lot in past years though
00:36 < hjax> i just spent the last half hour doing my teams first bytecode optimizations
00:36 < MiloATH> Well it isn't worth the time for me. My bots don't hit the limit
00:36 < hjax> i walk away from one minute and you guys are talking about a C style preprocessor for java
00:37  * hjax shudders 
00:37 < tfk> trying to get c++ style templates to work too
00:37 < tfk> going to write a joke-paper on bastardizing java by merging in the worst parts of C++
00:37 < tfk> lol
00:37 < zxqfl> i mean while you're at it
00:37 < tfk> mangled variable names
00:37 < tfk> etc
00:37 < zxqfl> might as well try to compile c++ to java
00:38 < MiloATH> I am looking at Waterloo's team, and they (@zxqfl) are using some interesting pathing
00:38 < zxqfl> mhm
00:38 < zxqfl> we turned off the lines for the tournament
00:39 < zxqfl> since they make the map impossible to see
00:39 < MiloATH> Okay. Those lines were like a light show
00:39 < zxqfl> yeah especially late game
00:39 < MiloATH> you can toggle them with v in the client
00:39 < zxqfl> i know, but i don't want to force the casters to do that
00:39 < zxqfl> would also hide rattatta's pokeball for example
00:40 < MiloATH> Ya, also then I might have been able to figure out your pathing
00:40 <@kazimuth> zxqfl: I've seriously considered using the C preprocessor for battlecode before -.-
00:40 < zxqfl> meh, we've had the lines in our unranked scrims for the past day or so
00:41 < zxqfl> we don't think it's an original enough idea to hide
00:41 <@kazimuth> Also yeah we'll probably skip indicators that are too obnoxious, but they're usually fine
00:41 < CertifiedPyro> @kazimuth how's the stream going to work? how much is actually going to be shown?
00:42 < hjax> kazimuth, you are going to skip my teams indicators
00:42 < hjax> unless you want to see pretty flowers and stars instead of the game
00:42 <@kazimuth> hjax: we may laugh for a bit
00:42 <@kazimuth> And, we're aiming for 5 hours max, at a typical 20ups
00:42 < hjax> our gardeners draw a star when they try to detect trees around them
00:42 <@kazimuth> which is a variable amount of matches, depending on lengths; they've been tending longer
00:43 < zxqfl> can assembly be translated to java?
00:43 < tfk> haha
00:43 < hjax> zxqfl, just write bytecode by hand
00:43 < tfk> then compile it to java
00:43 < MiloATH> haha
00:43 < tfk> so that it works for battlecode
00:43 <@kazimuth> actually though
00:43 < zxqfl> you would need to simulate goto with labelled breaks
00:43 <@kazimuth> javap is a thing?
00:43 < zxqfl> not sure how feasible that is
00:43 <@kazimuth> I don't actually recommend that though
00:43 < MiloATH> oh man
00:43 <@kazimuth> I mean you could write bytecode by hand for tight loops but it sounds p painful
00:44 <@kazimuth> not going to officially recommend that
00:44 < MiloATH> If you had more than a week before the tournament
00:44 < zxqfl> i thought you only provided java source code? how can you write bytecode directly?
00:44 <@kazimuth> ...oh yeah
00:44 <@kazimuth> never mind -.-
00:44 <@kazimuth> we could add assembly as an allowed language, that wouldn't go badly
00:45 < hjax> kazimuth, i need like a chart of all of the people on the streams faces and their irc usernames
00:45 < hjax> i never know who any of these people on stream are
00:45 < MiloATH> battlecode.org should have an about page for the devs
00:45 <@kazimuth> hjax: we can wear nametags
00:46 < tfk> is there going to be a green screen this time?
00:46 < tfk> :D
00:46 <@kazimuth> the dev who had that left -.-
00:46 < tfk> :(
00:46 <@kazimuth> we could probably find another one
00:46 < tfk> eh probably not worth it
00:46 < tfk> it was cool tho

00:49 < zxqfl> kazimuth do you know what issue was causing our robots to freeze?
00:51 <@kazimuth> hjax: somebody pointed out that I look like a young gabe newell? I'm that guy
00:51 <@kazimuth> zxqfl: uh, maybe
00:52 < zxqfl> are you allowed to tell us?
00:52 < hjax> kazimuth, the guy on the right? https://gyazo.com/73d64c270fb577394b9a6f28b00a7892
00:53 <@kazimuth> There were some rather large bugs that we've fixed which might have had something to do with it, but I didn't look into it specifically, I assumed it was a bug in your code; asking my team if anyone knows anything
00:53 <@kazimuth> hjax: yes
00:54 < tfk> have you folks audited the id generator?
00:54 <@kazimuth> I think someone's looking into that
00:54 < zxqfl> kazimuth i think it's unlikely to be a bug in our code since 2 others have encountered the same issue against the same opponent
00:54 <@kazimuth> the robots were getting ID 0s right?
00:55 <@kazimuth> zxqfl: I think we may have just fixed that actually
00:55 < tfk> I think that was for one archon on shrine
00:55 <@kazimuth> there was an issue with NaN directions
00:55 < tfk> worry was actually that battlecode usually doesn't have so many ids
00:55 <@kazimuth> I think the issue is that shrine is actually an invalid map
00:55 < zxqfl> oh, i saw that pull request but i thought there was no way it was related to all our robots freezing
00:55 < tfk> separate issue
00:55 < tfk> bullets get ids right?
00:55 < tfk> what if you run out of ids?
00:56 <@kazimuth> tfk's is shrine being invalid, zxqfl is related to NaNs
00:56 < tfk> not talking about shrine
00:56 < tfk> lol
00:56 < MiloATH> lol
00:56 <@kazimuth> there are 2^31 possible IDs
00:56 < MiloATH> 2^31 -1
00:56 <@kazimuth> tfk: the 0 ids on shrine is due to shrine
00:56 < tfk> ah its not 16 bits
00:56 < tfk> okay
00:56 <@kazimuth> well, actually 2^31-2, because 0 is in theory not allowed
00:57 <@kazimuth> tfk: https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode-server/blob/master/src/main/battlecode/world/IDGenerator.java
00:57 < MiloATH> Why not include negative ids?
00:58 < battlecode588> Does everyone make the qualifying tournament?
00:58 < zxqfl> yes
00:58 <@kazimuth> originally our schema enforced that they were positive but then that was removed
00:58 < MiloATH> Oh, Im dumb. they have to be indices in an array
00:59 < MiloATH> can't have negative indices
01:01 <@kazimuth> they're actually hash map keys
01:01 <@kazimuth> so they *could* be negative
